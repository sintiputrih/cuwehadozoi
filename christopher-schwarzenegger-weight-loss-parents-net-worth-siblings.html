As he was seen in the photo, he showed off the result of his fitness journey. Christopher, 24, looked considerably slim in a baggy grey shirt and shorts while getting pampered with his family.</span></p><p><span>The University of Michigan graduate, Christopher, wore a Lakers' mask and glanced through his phone while his feet were polished up by estheticians. He was sat next to his mother, who seemed to get a manicure too, and left the nail salon with freshened up feet in slides. Christopher stayed hydrated, carrying a large bottle of water.</span></p><p><span>Christopher has gradually lost some weight ever since he started to commit a healthier lifestyle last year and was praised by his star father for his fitness regimen in his birthday post where he said, <strong>“I can’t even keep up with you!”</strong></span></p><p><span>As per the reports, his goal was to get healthy for graduation and he stuck to it. He started working out and making better food choices. He was away at school, living like a typical college kid for a few years, but he’s growing up now and ready to take better care of himself. According to the insider, Christopher lost weight in old fashion way by cutting junk food and working out rather than a crash diet.</span></p><p><span>His brother, Patrick, also commented,<strong> “Proud of you. New Job. Crushing in the gym. A whole new person. Can’t wait to see what this year brings.”</strong></span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth Of Christopher Schwarzenegger</strong></span></h2><p><span>As per the reports, the net worth of the star kid is not much mentioned on the internet, having no knowledge of his source of income.
