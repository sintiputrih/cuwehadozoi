But why did they choose to keep their love story a secret? And why did they finally let the world in? Fans were surprised that Tom managed to keep the secret for so long since he is the king of spoilers. As proof of it, in 2016, just before the premiere of Spider-Man: Homecoming, Tom hosted a Q and A, and a fan asked, "Did training for Billy Elliot prepare you for this role?" The question referred to his first major role when he appeared in the stage musical at twelve years old. Tom answered by saying that his dance training prepared him for action movie choreography, then he talked about the leaked scene from Spider-Man: Homecoming, which he wasn't supposed to reveal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many fans can't understand how Tom kept the relationship with Zendaya a secret since 2017. That's when they first teamed up in Spider-Man: Homecoming and reprised their roles in 2019's Spider-Man: Far from Home, in which their characters began dating. Fans had always suspected that <a href=#>2017 was when both actors started dating</a>, but the two tried to keep the relationship a secret. However, they weren't doing a great job because, at the time, a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, "They started seeing each other while they were filming Spider-Man. They've been super careful to keep it private and out of the public eye, but they've gone on vacations with each other and try and spend as much time as possible with one another." Here is why Tom Holland and Zendaya kept their relationship a secret.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-did-zendaya-and-tom-holland-meet>When Did Zendaya And Tom Holland Meet?</h2><p>Tom Holland and Zendaya started interacting when they were announced as part of the Spider-Man cast. Then they slowly began popping up on each other's Instagram feeds. In July 2016, Tom posted a photo of him and Zendaya with another friend having fun in the pool. Then they sparked dating rumors in 2017. An insider told People at the time that they shared a sense of humor, saying, "They're both really ambitious, and they challenge each other — but, most importantly, they make each other crack up. They seem to have a really similar sense of humor and love joking around together. They have great banter back and forth."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Zendaya Says Tom Holland Helped Her Film Tough ‘Euphoria’ Storylines</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, Zendaya and Tom laughed off the dating rumor when she tweeted, "Wait, wait...my favorite is when it says we go on vacations together HA! I haven't been on a vacation in years! hbu @TomHolland1996???" to which Tom responded, "@Zendaya Does the press tour count." Zendaya then insisted the same year that they were just friends telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, "He's literally one of my best friends. This past how many months we've had to do press tours together. There's very few people that will understand what that's like at 20 years old."</p><h2 id=why-are-tom-holland-and-zendaya-so-private>Why Are Tom Holland And Zendaya So Private?</h2><p>Some of the best relationships started with the couple as great friends, so fans still had their hopes. At the time, the two probably kept the relationship a secret because it was still brand new, and they wanted to make sure that it was what they really wanted. Fans also said they kept the relationship private because they didn't want people to say they were only dating to promote the Spider-Man movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Tom did try to give hints that he was dating Zendaya over the years, but he wanted to make it as subtle as possible. For instance, at the 2018 Met Gala, where Zendaya totally owned the red carpet, Tom posted a photo of Zendaya at the Met Gala and captioned it, "All hail the queen, killing it, mate." In another instance, Tom posted a picture with Zendaya and their co-star. But he tagged the actress over his crotch instead of on her body.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Zendaya Pays Tribute To This Iconic ’90s Supermodel At 'Euphoria' Premiere</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zendaya tried to throw fans off and went along with the joke, commenting with many laughing, crying emojis, "I'm assuming because you don't know how to work IG, that's the reasoning behind my name placement."</p><h2 id=are-zendaya-and-tom-holland-still-together>Are Zendaya And Tom Holland Still Together?</h2><p>As for their relationship timeline, which they desperately tried to keep a secret, the two were together and broke up. Then got together again. In July 2019, when they had broken up, Tom was spotted getting very cozy with Olivia Bolton in London's Hyde Park.</p><p><a href=#>Zendaya also dated her co-star Jacob Elordi between August 2019 and March 2020</a>. Tom also reportedly got another girlfriend, Nadia Parkes. So the Spider-Man stars seemingly got back together after their relationships failed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On July 2nd, 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> shared pictures of Zendaya and Tom out and about in Los Angeles, where they shared the sweetest kiss. They were also photographed on a dinner date the day before the kissing photo surfaced, and TMZ shared the pictures of them together in a Thai restaurant. Finally, toward the end of July, Us Weekly confirmed they were a couple. Nowadays, <a href=#>Zendaya and Tom Holland are still going strong</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Tom Holland And Zendaya's Most Adorable Interview Moments</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdr7KvsMCymGaZnpl6tbvMZp%2BopJyWu6V5yp6nrWWknbKqvoyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmmV2osqS%2BxK1m</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-zendaya-and-tom-holland-kept-their-relationship-a-secret.html&text=Why%20Zendaya%20And%20Tom%20Holland%20Kept%20Their%20Relationship%20A%20Secret&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-zendaya-and-tom-holland-kept-their-relationship-a-secret.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-zendaya-and-tom-holland-kept-their-relationship-a-secret.html&title=Why%20Zendaya%20And%20Tom%20Holland%20Kept%20Their%20Relationship%20A%20Secret" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-zendaya-and-tom-holland-kept-their-relationship-a-secret.html&title=Why%20Zendaya%20And%20Tom%20Holland%20Kept%20Their%20Relationship%20A%20Secret" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-zendaya-and-tom-holland-kept-their-relationship-a-secret.html&title=Why%20Zendaya%20And%20Tom%20Holland%20Kept%20Their%20Relationship%20A%20Secret" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-zendaya-and-tom-holland-kept-their-relationship-a-secret.html&description=Why%20Zendaya%20And%20Tom%20Holland%20Kept%20Their%20Relationship%20A%20Secret" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-many-teams-did-derrick-rose-play-for.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How many teams did Derrick Rose play for?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vice-ganda-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vice Ganda  Bio (Wiki) ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
