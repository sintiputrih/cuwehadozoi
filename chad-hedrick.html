He was star-struck after Derek won the gold medal at the 2002 Olympics.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Consequently, it led Chad Hedrick to switch to the Ice. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After just one year of ice training, Chad won the </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>World</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;All-round Speed Skating&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Championships&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>in February 2004.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During the event, Chad even knocked off the world record points by reducing it to 150.478.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, he set six world records by being the first man to skate 6.2 miles (10,000m) in history in under 13 minutes.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Besides, Chad lived up to his reputation by winning the gold medal in the 5,000 meters event on March 12, 2004. The World Single Distance Championships was held in Seoul, South Korea.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Additionally, during the same year, Hedrick successfully defended the 5,000m world title in Inzell, Germany. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, he lost the World All-round Speed Skating Championships title in 2005 to Shani Davis.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nonetheless, Hedrick, aka The Exception, remained a renowned figure as he currently ranks 3rd in an unofficial world ranking.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Formidable Ice Man</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Chad Hedrick, the “Iceman,” earned his nickname from his loving fans because of his skill and talent on the Ice.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Despite being a fresher in skating, Chad did not disappoint and improved as time went by.
