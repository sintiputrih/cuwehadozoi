Not only people loved his journey as a survivor, leader, and advocate they also became curious about his personal life.</p><p style=text-align:left>So, now, in the rest of this writing, we shall tell you all about his mother Maritza Argibay.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Maritza Argibay, Maxwell Frost’s Mother</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Maxwell Frost’s family’s story begins in Cuba, with his grandmother Yeya. She and Maxwell’s birth mom came to Florida from Cuba during the Freedom Flights in the early 1960s with only a suitcase and no money. As Maxwell shares his grandmother worked in Miami factories for more than 70 hours a week, where she was exploited and forced to accept harsh working conditions in order to make a life for her family.</p><p style=text-align:left>But, the mother, whom we spoke about just now, is not Maritza Argibay. Instead, she is the one who gave birth to Maxwell.</p><p style=text-align:left>According to Maxwell, his biological mother was a victim of the system and enmeshed in trying circumstances as she was caught in a cycle of drugs, crime, and violence while pregnant. She did not have healthcare and was not able to see a doctor even once. So, in Maxwell’s words, as the mother of seven, she made the difficult decision to put him up for adoption because she lacked the resources to care for and raise another child. That is when Maritza Argibay comes into the picture.</p><p>She and her husband adopted Maxwell at birth and the rest is history.</p><p>On Women’s Day one time Maxwell tributed his mother Maritza for spending her entire career teaching and mentoring kids who have special needs. He shared how every day she comes home from work excited to tell everyone about what happened at school. “The special thing about those stories is that she always calls her students her kids. It’s more than just a job for her, it’s a calling”, so like that he went on to gush about his “beautiful” mother.</p><p>Maritza, the way her son puts it, loves and treats each one of her students like they are her family. So, like him, we also believe that the world need more educators and humans like her.</p><p>As for Maxwell’s biological mother, she&nbsp;was part Lebanese and part Puerto Rican, and his dad was Haitian.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Maritza Argibay Husband And Kids</strong></h3><p>Maritza Argibay’s husband is Patrick Frost and he is an award-winning multi-instrumentalist, composer, and producer.</p><p>A White-ethnic, unlike his wife, his family moved from Topeka, Kansas to the island of Bermuda. From there the family made another move to Columbus, Ohio where Patrick began playing Trombone and Piano and eventually found himself at Berklee College of Music and then at the Capital University in Columbus.</p><p>In 1982 he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and was stationed at Wright-Patterson AFB. Then likely upon his retirement from there, he co-founded a production company specializing in music jingles for radio and TV as well as scoring for corporate film and video, in 1987. Fast forward to today and Patrick’s studio work has remained steady through the years.</p><p>He also continued to be together and married Maritza as he turned 66 years old on 10 November 2022.</p><p>Maritza and Patrick happen to be the proud parents of also their daughter, Maria Frost who graduated from Osceola County School for The Arts in May 2018. In October 2021, she started working as a full-time studio artist at Merlin Entertainments while also working as a field organizer at Florida Democratic Party.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Maritza Argibay Age</strong></h3><p>Maritza Argibay was born in 1956. So, she reached the age of&nbsp;66 in 2022.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Who Are Maritza Argibay Parents?</strong></h3><p>Maritza Argibay’s mother is Zenaida Argibay and she passed away recently on 15 October 2022 at the age of 97. Zenaida not only was a good mother but also a wonderful grandmother to Maxwell. He said that she was one of the most important people in his life.</p><p>According to her family, Zenaida passed peacefully at home here in Orlando with her family by her side. She was a professional chef, a believer, a fighter, and an orphan.</p><p>For the first two years of Maxwell’s life, the elderly even moved to Orlando from Hialeah to help raise him. Maxwell recalled how she would sing, read bible verses, watch the three stooges with her, sneak her coca-cola, pray, give life advice, and give him an unconditional love that, he confirms, has in part fueled his life and love for others.</p><p>Late Zenaida came to America from Cuba during the freedom flights in the late 1960s with her daughters, with no money, and no English.</p><p>Maritza’s father Pepe, also known as Pipo, is also no more. Maxwell shared on social media that when his grandpa <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>died, his grandma found community at a Hialeah Housing Authority Affordable Housing complex and it was a second home to Maxwell.</span></p><p>We can also tell you that Maritza has a sister named Sandy Argibay.
