Despite the fact that he is not married, people have been hunting for his marriage relationship and his spouse for some reason. We know he’s had a lot of girlfriends, but has he ever been in a marriage relationship?</strong></p><p>Jimmy, the 31-year-old quarterback, has a social media presence, but he rarely publishes personal information. Let’s find out who Jimmy Garoppolo’s wife is or if he is dating someone else in the piece below.</p><h2><span id=What_is_Jimmy_Garoppolo8217s_wife8217s_name_Does_he_have_a_girlfriend>What is Jimmy Garoppolo’s wife’s name? Does he have a girlfriend?</span></h2><p>Garoppolo, who stands six feet two inches tall, has yet to marry or go down the aisle. He isn’t a husband to anyone right now. The personal life of the 2014 NFL draft is as enigmatic as it gets. Garoppolo still hasn’t found the right woman.</p><p>Jimmy Garoppolo’s current relationship status is unknown, but he is thought to be single. Nothing is known about his girlfriend, assuming he has one.</p><p>It has been said that Jimmy dislikes discussing his romances or who his current romantic partner is. The two-time Super Bowl champion seemed to go to great lengths to keep his personal life out of the spotlight.</p><h2><span id=Is_He_Getting_Married>Is He Getting Married?</span></h2><p>So yet, Jimmy does not appear to be planning a wedding. He has not spoken about his marriage as of 2023. Having said that, we eagerly await the day when he finds the perfect match for himself.</p><h2><span id=Jimmy_Garoppolo8217s_Previous_Wives>Jimmy Garoppolo’s Previous Wives</span></h2><p>Although he is currently perceived as a single man, Garoppolo did date multiple women in the past. One such name is Alexandra King, with whom Jimmy began dating in early 2017. Garoppolo was a member of the New England Patriots at the time.</p><p>The Rolling Meadows graduate never publicly disclosed or hinted about his relationship with King. People learned of their allegiance when Alexandra tweeted Jimmy’s photo as her then-Valentine on Valentine’s Day 2018.</p><p>A month later, the couple went to Disneyland together as well. According to sources, they were holding hands and walking by each other’s arms. Then there were images of them kissing in June.</p><p>Jimmy and King, on the other hand, split up in the latter part of 2018. Jimmy Garoppolo’s girlfriend, King, is a Boston native who works as an Instagram model.</p><p>In an interview with Bleacher Report, the NFL player stated that his relationship with King was nothing more than a friendship and that nothing romantic was going on.</p><p>Alexandra later removed photos of her ex-boyfriend from her Instagram account.</p><p>When Jimmy sustained an ACL tear that season, King posted an Instagram story with the hashtag ‘karma.’ People felt Alexandra was slamming the 49ers quarterback for how he dumped her or how he addressed their relationship in public.</p><h2><span id=Garoppolo_also_dated_adult_actress_Kiara_Mia>Garoppolo also dated adult actress Kiara Mia.</span></h2><p>Jimmy Garoppolo, Mike Garoppolo’s brother, reportedly dated adult film star Kiara Mia after King. Their romance most likely began in 2020. Some believe it began in 2018, shortly after the end of Garoppolo’s relationship with King.</p><p>Their first public appearance was at a Beverly Hills restaurant, where they were reportedly eating supper. However, neither Mia nor Garoppolo ever validated this relationship. Mia, Jimmy Garoppolo’s purported girlfriend, also revealed in an interview that they met as friends and nothing more.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind in this scenario is that Mia is 41 years older than Garoppolo, who is 26.</p><h2><span id=Other_Women_Allegedly_Dated_by_Garoppolo>Other Women Allegedly Dated by Garoppolo</span></h2><p>In late 2018, Bleacher Report stated that Jimmy’s ex-teammate Brady and his ex-wife, Gisele Bundchen, tried to hook him up with one of their model acquaintances. Garoppolo was still a Patriots player at the time. However, neither the model nor her name were ever reported by Bleacher Report.</p><p>Regardless, the attempt to make a link between Garoppolo and the mystery model failed. Another Jimmy Garoppolo romance rumor began in 2019, when Garoppolo was once again in the news for dating a VIP bottle service female. She used to go by the handle @shaybaevip on Instagram. This hearsay began as a rumor in a gossip website’s tip box. Nonetheless, Jimmy was observed unfollowing @shaybaevip on social media shortly after the publication of this news.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Tantoo Cardinal&#39;s Wife, Kids, And Family"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/tantoo-cardinals-wife-kids-and-family/"}{"1":51}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Tantoo Cardinal’s Wife, Kids, And Family</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>American football quarterback</a> <a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity wife</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>LaDonna Hughley</a></h3>LaDonna Hughley estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
