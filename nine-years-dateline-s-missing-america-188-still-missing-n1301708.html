We asked our Facebook community a simple question the night before. "Do you know anyone who has simply vanished?"</p><p>The response was overwhelming. Since that first post, every week we have tried to feature the story of a different missing person brought to our attention by a member of our social communities. And this year, we created a new podcast series called ‘Dateline: Missing in America,’ which highlighted six cases of the cases featured in our digital series. You can learn more about the cases featured in Season 1 and listen <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>Read and share their stories. Someone, somewhere, saw something.</p><p>If you know someone who is missing and would like their story featured, you can <a href=#>submit information here</a>, send us a message on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or email <a href=#>dateline.contactus@nbcuni.com</a>.</p><p>This article mentions suicide.

She never made it. Police said security cameras captured Duffy leaving the Maintree Apartments on foot around 12:15 p.m. For weeks, law enforcement, assisted by K-9 units, searched the area where Duffy was known to frequently travel by foot. Duffy’s family told Dateline that she did not own a car and usually walked everywhere she went. According to Homer Police Department Lieutenant Ryan Browning, search dogs tracked Duffy’s scent into downtown Homer but then lost it, reaching a point search-dog handlers call a “car pick up.” Duffy’s mother, Sara Berg, said the family believed someone picked her up in a vehicle and that she had been abducted. Sara filed a presumptive death petition for her daughter in April 2021. Two months later, a six-member jury decided that Duffy could be presumed dead. It also determined that her death was likely a homicide. Duffy’s parents long believed their daughter was murdered, but said they were still surprised to learn her death was a homicide. On May 9, 2022, the Homer Police Department <a href=#>posted on their Facebook page</a> that they had arrested 32-year-old Kirby Foleni Calderwood in relation to Duffy’s disappearance. In May of 2022, Dateline obtained the arrest warrant affidavit that Investigator Matt Haney of the Homer Police Department submitted. The affidavit detailed an anonymous tip that came in on April 14, 2022. The tip was “very specific” as to “how the kidnapping, murder and destruction of evidence were committed.” The tipster named Calderwood, who had previously been reported to the Homer Police Department and was already under investigation in the case, as the person responsible. Investigator Haney wrote in the affidavit that “Calderwood has an extensive history of abusive violent sexual behavior towards women and fantasized about torturing and killing someone.” Calderwood lived in Alaska for a few years, which is when he met Duffy. At some point in the past couple of years, Calderwood returned to Utah and married for a third time. Investigator Haney wrote in the affidavit that the tipster provided a specific detail in regards to Calderwood keeping Duffy’s wristwatch, which she said “may have been a Timex.” Haney wrote that they found photos of Duffy wearing a watch and her mother and stepfather confirmed it was a Timex. The tipster also said Calderwood admitted to her that he had tortured and killed Duffy, threw her phone in a nearby lake and disposed of her body in a dumpster. On May 5, 2022, Haney and the Ogden, Utah Police Department executed multiple search warrants related to Calderwood. Officials found a small women's Timex watch in Calderwood’s dresser drawer that matched the description of Duffy’s watch. That day, Investigator Haney also interviewed Calderwood’s current wife, who was reportedly “very afraid.” The following day, according to the affidavit, the wife called Investigator Haney and disclosed that she had been the anonymous tipster who called the month prior. This led the Ogden Police to issue a warrant for Calderwood’s arrest. He was arrested on May 9, 2022, and was initially held at the Weber County Correctional Facility in Utah. He was charged with kidnapping, murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree and tampering with physical evidence. In November, Calderwood was transported to Alaska. Alaska Department of Corrections Public Information Officer, Betsy Holley, confirmed to Dateline in an email that “Calderwood is currently housed in Wildwood Correctional Center.” He is expected to be in court in early 2023. Calderwood has not yet entered a plea. Police urge anyone with information on the case or the location of Duffy’s body to contact the Homer Police Department at 907-235-3150 or Crime Stoppers at 907-283-8477.</p><p><strong>Doren Sanford</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Doren Sanford was in Fairbanks, Alaska on August 20, 2020 to look at some property he was interested in purchasing when he vanished. He was last known to be in the area of Airport Road searching for his lost Rottweiler, Groot. Both are missing. Doren, who was 34 at the time, was raised in Tok with his large extended family, and lived in Anchorage where he worked as a heavy equipment operator/laborer. He had recently started his own business, Sanford Home Repair & Remodel. Lieutenant Jess Carson of the Alaska State Troopers told Dateline in March of 2021, that they continue to look for Doren and believe that finding Groot may lead to answers on Doren’s whereabouts. He added that troopers suspect foul play in Doren’s disappearance and believe they’ve already spoken to people who know what happened to him. Doren is described as being 5’10”, weighing approximately 140-160 lbs., with brown hair and blue eyes. A Facebook page “<a href=#>Find Doren Sanford”</a> has been created to share developments in the case. In November of 2022, investigators from the Alaska State Troopers, Lantz Dahlke and Lonny Piscoya, told Dateline that Doren’s case has been added to the list of cases being investigated by the new Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons investigative team, which was created by the Alaska Department of Public Safety in May of this year. In addition to investigating both active and cold cases, officials will be working to improve communications between partnering organizations and the MMIP, by providing fresh perspective into unsolved cases. If you have tips on Doren's case please call Lantz Dahlke at 907-451-5919 or Lonny Piscoya at 907-764-3864 or their tip line at 411.</p><p><strong>Erin Marie Gilbert</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Erin Marie Gilbert went on a first date to the Girdwood Forest Fair in Girdwood, Alaska on July 1, 1995 and hasn’t been seen since. The 24-year-old had moved to Alaska the year prior and was working as a nanny. Stephanie Gilbert-Juarez told Dateline that her sister’s date on July 1 was with David “Dave” Combs, a man whom Stephanie said Erin had met a few nights earlier at a local bar. They drove to the Girdwood Forest Fair and according to witness statements to Alaska State Troopers, Erin was last seen at a beer garden with Combs before they left around 6:00 p.m. In a statement to authorities in 1995, Dave Combs said they walked to his car, but the lights had been left on and it would not start. He said he told Erin he would walk to a nearby friend’s house for help. He said he walked for about two hours, but was unable to find his friend’s house. He told authorities when he returned to the car, Erin was gone and he figured she’d returned to the fair. Combs said when he tried to start the car this time, it worked. He stated he went back to the fair and searched for Erin until about 1:00 a.m. Lieutenant Randy McPherron of the Alaska State Troopers told Dateline in 2019 they haven’t received any leads in several years, but that they’d follow up on any that come in. He added there are no suspects in Erin’s disappearance. Erin’s case is one of the cases being looked into by the newly-created Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons investigative team. Erin is described as 5’11”, 145 lbs., with brown hair and hazel eyes. She would be in her early 50s today. If you have tips, please call investigators from the Alaska State Troopers, Lantz Dahlke at 907-451-5919 or Lonny Piscoya at 907-764-3864 or their tip line at 411.</p><p><strong>Florence Okpealuk</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>33-year-old Florence Okpealuk was last seen on West Beach in Nome, Alaska on October 14, 2020. According to Florence’s sister Blaire, a witness saw Florence leaving a tent on the beach at 4:00 p.m. Blaire told Dateline she found Florence’s shoes and jacket left outside of that tent. The Nome Police Department enlisted the help of the Alaska State Troopers and the FBI to aid in the search. Search efforts have included mini-submarines, helicopters and private citizens. In 2022, the Nome Police Department conducted a search using cadaver dogs. Florence is 5’2”, 142 lbs., with black hair and eyes. She has no scars, marks or tattoos. It is unknown what Florence was last seen wearing or which direction she was headed when she left the tent on that beach. If you have information about Florence’s disappearance please contact the Nome Police Department at (907) 443-5262.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Alicia Navarro</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Fifteen-year-old Alicia Navarro was last seen at her home in Glendale, Arizona, in the very early morning hours of September 15, 2019. When her parents woke up, she was gone and had left a note for them that read, “I ran away. I will be back. I swear. I’m sorry.” Alicia’s laptop was also gone, but her chargers were left behind in her room. Alicia’s mother, Jessica Nuñez, told Dateline in 2020 that she is especially worried because her daughter is on the autism spectrum and is known to be shy or anxious in some social situations. Alicia takes medicine and has a compromised immune system and Jessica has been worried that her daughter’s anxiety may have overwhelmed her amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Glendale Police Sergeant Randy Stewart told Dateline it was not known if Alicia was lured away or if she left on her own, but they were continuing to search for her and said they could use the public’s help for new information. The Glendale Police Department is working with the FBI and the Center for Missing and Exploited Children on the case. A Facebook page called ‘<a href=#>Finding Alicia Navarro</a>’ has been created for anyone wanting to discuss the case or provide information that may lead to her whereabouts. Alicia has brown eyes and hair. She was 4’5”, weighed 95 lbs., and had braces at the time of her disappearance. She may have been wearing a sweatshirt, a whitewash denim overall skirt and black and white Vans-type sneakers and carrying a silver Apple MacBook Pro laptop. If you have any information on Alicia’s whereabouts, call the Glendale Police at 623-930-3000.</p><p><strong>Daniel Robinson</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>On June 23, 2021, 24-year-old Daniel Robinson, drove his 2017 blue Jeep Renegade away from his job site in the desert area west of Sun Valley Parkway, just north of Cactus Road in Buckeye, Arizona and hasn’t been seen since. In July of 2021, Daniel’s Jeep was discovered by a rancher in a ravine on his property about four miles southwest of the jobsite where Daniel was last seen. Police say the Jeep appeared to have rolled and landed on its side. Several of Daniel’s belongings were found at the scene, including clothes, his cell phone, wallet, and keys. A ground search was conducted, but nothing was found. Daniel’s father, David Robinson, traveled cross-country to search for his son. He spoke with Josh Mankiewicz for an episode of the new podcast series “<a href=#>Dateline: Missing in America</a>” released this summer and said he would not leave Arizona until he finds his son. “It seems like it is simple, but when you are actually on the ground looking, it takes time,” he said. “You know, even with the people that we have it takes time... It’s a lot of time, effort and money to keep things going and I get weary at times that it is going to fade eventually and I won’t have that kind of support anymore.” David remains determined to get answers. “As a father, my drive is to find my son. So I will do whatever it takes to make it happen,” he vowed. Daniel is 5’8”, and weighs about 165 lbs. He has black hair and brown eyes. He is missing part of his right arm from the forearm down. Anyone with information on Daniel’s case is asked to call the Buckeye Police at 623-349-6400 or the Buckeye Police tip line at 623-349-6411 or the tipline created by Daniel's father at 844-602-0660.</p><p><strong>Michelle Bernstein-Schultz</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>36-year-old Michelle Bernstein-Schultz was last heard from on June 29, 2022. Michelle’s sister, Daniella, told Dateline that at the time of her disappearance, Michelle had been living with her boyfriend in Phoenix, Arizona. According to Daniella, on June 29, Michelle had been texting a friend all day. The last message the friend received from her was around 4:03 p.m. Michelle’s mother, Patricia, told Dateline that the next day, she received a concerning text from Michelle’s boyfriend. He told her that Michelle had not been seen or heard from since June 29 and that he had reported her missing. According to Patricia, she then called Michelle’s boyfriend and he told her that earlier that day, Michelle told him that she wasn’t feeling well and didn’t want to be bothered. So when he got home later that night, he went to sleep on the couch. Patricia told Dateline he said when he got up the next morning, June 30, Michelle wasn’t in the bedroom. Patricia said that he told her all of Michelle’s belongings were left behind including her keys, phone, license, dog, and car. Dateline attempted to reach out to Michelle’s boyfriend for comment but was unsuccessful. In July, the Phoenix Police Department posted on <a href=#>Twitter</a> that Michelle was “last seen on June 29th in the area of 40th St and Greenway Rd” in Phoenix. The police did not indicate whether they believe foul play is involved and no persons of interest have been named in Michelle’s disappearance. There have been no updates on Michelle’s case since.

Brad’s girlfriend, Megan Coady, told Dateline in 2018 that she and Brad had gotten into an argument the night before and he told her he was going on a walk through the woods to cool off. But when she woke up later that morning and Brad hadn’t returned home, Megan grew concerned. After a few days of searching, the family called authorities to report Brad missing. Police told Dateline in April of 2018, that they interviewed Brad’s family, friends and coworkers, but there were no persons of interest as of 2018. Foul play is suspected in Brad’s disappearance. If you have any information on Brad’s whereabouts, please contact the Ashley County Sheriff's Office at (870) 853-2040.</p><p><strong>Brooke Allensworth</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Brooke Allensworth was last seen on July 12, 2018, a day after getting her hair and nails done at a salon in Independence County, Arkansas.

He was captured that day on security footage in a Studio City 7-11 around 2:00 p.m. after being dropped off there by an Uber.

It was just before 1:00 a.m. on June 9, 2016, when the 31-year-old was seen leaving the casino in her dark gray Chevrolet Malibu. Several hours later, a call came in to the California State Highway Patrol that a burning vehicle had been discovered in an orchard near Goshen, about 30 miles from the casino. It was Cecilia’s car, but she was not inside. Cecilia was last seen with her husband, Francisco Valdivia. In December of 2016, the Tulare County District Attorney's office filed charges against Valdivia for felony murder and arson. Rosalina Lopez, a woman who was also married to Valdivia, was charged with one felony count of being an accessory to murder after the fact. Valdivia and Lopez were arraigned at the Tulare County Pretrial Facility on December 14, 2016. There was no bail set for Valdivia and bail for Lopez was set at $500,000. Dateline has reached out to the Tulare County District Attorney's office multiple times in the past few weeks for an update on the status of the case, but has yet to hear back. Cecilia’s body has still not been found. If you have any information in Cecilia’s case, please call the Tulare County Sheriff's Department at (559) 735-1880.</p><p><strong>Christina Bastian</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>High school teacher Christina Bastian and her dog, Coco, were last seen together in the early hours of November 1, 2015, at a friend's home near Apple Valley, California. The 34-year-old’s belongings were later found strewn along Highway 247, near Lucerne Valley. Her truck was located, abandoned, on a dirt road along Highway 62. The next day, her dog Coco was found alive by a stranger nearly 70 miles from where the truck had been located.

Dane’s mother, Deborah, told Dateline in 2021 that she spoke to her son that day. She said that in the days leading up to his disappearance, Dane had become mentally distressed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and that he had been driving back and forth between their home in Brentwood and Santa Cruz, where he is an engineering student. For the past two years, Dane’s family has used social media to reach out to the community for information on his whereabouts. A Facebook group ‘<a href=#>Searching for Dane Elkins</a>’ and the TikTok account <a href=#>@KindnessMom</a> were launched to help spread the word. According to Dane’s mother’s Tik Tok page, there have been reported sightings of Dane that she believes are legitimate, the most recent being in the Northern California area, particularly in Santa Cruz. These possible sightings give her hope that her son is still alive. The family asks anyone who believes they’ve spotted someone who might be Dane to take a photo of the individual and send it to <a href=#>searchingfordaneelkins@gmail.com</a>, which will allow the family to better determine if it actually could be Dane before passing it along to investigators. Dane is described as being 5’11”, and weighing 170 lbs. He has brown hair and green eyes. Dane would be 23 years old today. Anyone with information on his location is urged to call the LAPD’s Missing Persons Unit at (213) 996-1800. During non-business hours or on weekends, calls should be directed to 1-877-LAPD-24-7 (877-527-3247). Anyone wishing to remain anonymous should call Crime Stoppers at 800-222-TIPS (800-222-8477).

Dateline spoke with Keith Harper who said that he and Dia started dating in 2016 and got engaged in 2019. According to Keith, the two were living together in her Mountain Center home where he worked as the property’s ranch manager. Keith told Dateline that on June 6, 2020, he and Dia had lunch together around 2:30 p.m. in their home and then he left to do some work on the property. He said when he returned to the home around 7:30 p.m. he found Dia’s cell phone charging in their bedroom, her purse was in the house, and her truck was outside. Dia was nowhere to be found. Keith told Dateline that after Dia didn’t return home that night, he reported her missing the next day. Dia’s son, Clinton Abrams, told Dateline he learned about his mother’s disappearance from one of her neighbors and immediately left his home in San Diego to go to the ranch. “I drove up there that Sunday,” he said. And by Monday, “missing persons came out, homicide came out, there was a dive team.” Clinton told Dateline he believes Keith Harper knows more about Dia’s disappearance than he has revealed. When asked by Dateline if he had something to do with Dia’s disappearance, Keith Harper responded, “Absolutely not.” In August 2022, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office told Dateline that the case is being investigated by the homicide unit and that no further details of the case will be released. Dia is 5’6” with blue eyes. When she was last seen, Dia’s hair was blonde and she weighed 135 lbs. Anyone with information on Dia’s disappearance is asked to contact the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department after-hours hotline at 951-776-1099, Investigator Loureiro at 760-578-2101, or Investigator Vasquez at 951-203-3767.</p><p><strong>Diana Rose Alejandre Garcia Gonzalez</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Diana Rose Alejandre Garcia Gonzalez had been known to travel between Winterhaven, California, Yuma, Arizona, and Mexico, but when her family hadn’t been able to contact her for two months they reported her missing in June 2020. In September 2020, Dateline spoke with Investigator J. Hurtado of the Imperial County Sheriff’s Office in El Centro, California, who said Diana was last known to be in Winterhaven at the home she shared with her girlfriend, Danielle Meeden. Authorities believe she disappeared on May 4, 2020. Hurtado said they were actively searching for Diana and had interviewed several people about her disappearance. Investigator Hurtado would not comment further on details due to the ongoing nature of the investigation. “There are many stories and rumors around this case,” Investigator Hurtado said at the time. “So it’s hard to say at this time if foul play is involved.” There have been no updates since the last time Dateline reported on this story. Diana is described as being 5'3" and weighing approximately 180 lbs., with brown hair and eyes. Diana’s family said she dyes her hair often, so it may be a lighter brown or blonde color. Anyone who may have information about Diane’s whereabouts is asked to contact the Investigation Unit at 442-265-2105 and reference case #2006-1642.</p><p><strong>Donald Cavanaugh</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Donald Cavanaugh was one of two men who disappeared more than a decade ago after working on the same small horse ranch in California outside Westport, a town with only 60 residents. Donald, then 63, was reported missing in May 2005, in Ukiah, California after a dispute with his nephew, James DeNoyer, who was the ranch owner. David Neily, 69, was reported missing in Westport, California just one year later, also reportedly after a confrontation with DeNoyer. Both men's vehicles were found on DeNoyer's ranch property. DeNoyer denies having any information or involvement in either man’s disappearance and has not been named a suspect. For years, both men had been feared dead. In May 2021, human remains were found by an employee at a private nature reserve in an old-growth Douglas-fir forest in Branscomb, about 3.5 miles from where David Neily’s car had been found 15 years earlier. DNA analysis of the remains and dental records examined by Jim Wood, a California Assembly member and forensic dentistry expert, determined they belonged to Neily. The examinations found no evidence of trauma and the sheriff’s office continues to investigate the circumstances surrounding Neily’s disappearance. Donald Cavanaugh is still missing. If you have information about either of these cases, you are encouraged to call the Mendocino County Sheriff's Office at (707) 234-2100.</p><p><strong>Elaine Park</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The last time anyone saw 20-year-old Elaine Park was in the early morning hours of Saturday, January 28, 2017. Elaine had driven to her on-again, off-again boyfriend’s family’s home in Calabasas, California the previous evening. Elaine’s mother, Susan, told Dateline the young man told her that Elaine had suffered some type of panic attack around 4:00 a.m. the next morning. He said despite his efforts to have her stay, Elaine drove off in her car. Security images from the property show Elaine’s car leaving the home, although authorities aren’t certain who was driving. Three days later, Elaine’s 2015 Honda Accord was spotted parked on the shoulder of Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. The vehicle was unlocked and the key was still in the ignition. Authorities found Elaine’s cell phone and other personal belongings inside the car. According to the ‘<a href=#>Help Find Elaine Park</a>’ Facebook page, there is a family and friend reward fund for $25,000, as well as an independent reward fund for $250,000.

She was first reported missing on October 20 after she failed to pick her son up from school. Hours after Heidi was last seen, her dog was found on the 28th floor of an apartment building in downtown Los Angeles. Police have said their investigation led them to the Chiquita Canyon Landfill, about 40 miles northwest of the downtown location where Heidi was last seen. “Forensic evidence was located inside the building which has led detectives to believe an incident occurred resulting in Planck’s death,” the Los Angeles Police Department said in an online statement. On November 29, 2021, police began searching the landfill for evidence connected to Heidi’s disappearance. Police said in the same statement that they were looking in "a specific area" of the landfill for human remains. Police have asked for tips from anyone who was at the residential building at 1201 S. Hope St., listed online as the Level Downtown Flower building, on or around October 17. In July 2022, Dateline featured Heidi’s case in season one of the new podcast series “<a href=#>Dateline: Missing in America</a>.” Among others, Josh Mankiewicz spoke with KNBC reporter Eric Leonard who has been covering the case in Los Angeles. "By combining the videos that captured who goes in and out, the access controls that record date, time, doorways of who goes in and who goes out,” he said, “they were able to narrow down who could have been involved and began to focus the investigation on them.” Leonard also told Dateline that "there was a pretty clear understanding amongst the investigators that she had attended a party or get-together and went into distress -- had some kind of medical episode.” He added that “Police were able to confirm that she -- after she died -- was likely put into an upper floor trash chute and her body fell into a giant industrial-sized dumpster and trash compactor in the ground floor of the building.” Heidi's remains have not been located. Anyone with information on Heidi’s case is urged to contact the Los Angeles Police Department, Missing Persons Unit, at (213) 996-1800 or 1-877-LAPD-24-7 (877-527-3247).

His family says he suffers from depression and bipolar disorder and is worried because it’s unlike him to not be in contact with someone. He did not have a cell phone or ID on him, but could have been traveling to Denver or Salt Lake City, where he has friends, or to his hometown in Minnesota. Family members, friends and volunteers have scoured the woods and neighborhoods around Agoura Hills, Westlake, and Thousand Oaks, as well as Venice Beach and Malibu, searching shelters and homeless encampments. Jack is described by his family as a kind, beautiful soul who is creative and loves to draw, but also athletic and loves to surf and snowboard. He’s 6’3”, weighs about 180 lbs., and has blue eyes and shaggy strawberry-blond hair. He has a tattoo of a sparrow on his upper right thigh and circle tattoos on his chest.

Karlie’s stepmother, Melissa, told Dateline she picked Karlie up from town and brought her home around 9:00 p.m. According to Melissa, they ate dinner together before Karlie went to bed. Karlie’s father, Zachary, told Dateline that Karlie seemed “disoriented” before she went to bed, but would not comment further on her condition. Melissa said she went to Karlie’s room early the next morning to check on her stepdaughter, but Karlie was nowhere to be found. Five months later, Melissa appeared on the Dr. Phil daytime talk show, and told Dr. Phil that she had lied to NBC when she spoke to Dateline. “Melissa, you told NBC, the next morning that at 5:45 a.m., you did your usual routine of opening up the kids’ doors, saying good morning, getting them ready for school -- that sort of thing. Did you -- she was still in bed at that time -- did you go back and lay down?” Dr. Phil asked Melissa on the show which aired on March 25, 2019. “No. That -- the Dateline NBC?” Melissa answered. “Yeah, that was a false story. Because I wasn’t – it was a lie about checking in on Karlie. Because it was in the beginning, and I didn’t know what to say and – I shouldn’t have even done the interview.” Karlie’s mother, Lindsay Fairley, who lives in Nevada, told Dateline in 2018 that she had been sick to her stomach from the pain her daughter’s disappearance had caused. Authorities say Karlie was last seen wearing a white t-shirt and gray sweatpants.

She told him to call 911 and go to the hospital. The 43-year-old was taken by ambulance from his hotel in San Diego to UCSD in Hillcrest. Three hours later, according to Donna, security cameras showed him walking out of the hospital. He never returned to his hotel, and he never called his mother back. Because of privacy laws, it’s unclear if Lance was treated at the hospital. Officials with the San Diego Police Department are investigating, but little has been released in connection with the case. There is a Facebook page called ‘<a href=#>Lance Perkins Missing Person</a>’ which his family keeps updated with any new information they receive.

According to family, the 32-year-old hung out with a new friend until around 4:30 a.m., and then drove to the Malibu Canyons after dropping the friend off at her house. According to the family, who had access to his phone records through his ex-girlfriend, Matthew sent several texts and posted to Snapchat later that morning. Early the next morning, according to a press release by the Los Angeles Police Department, Matthew’s car was found “abandoned on the Topanga Tower Motorway, near Rosas Overlook, and above the Backbone Trail and Hondo Canyon areas.” Since Matthew’s disappearance, authorities, friends, and family have conducted multiple searches, but nothing of significance has been found.

The casino was less than a 15-minute drive from Max’s house in Bookings, Oregon, and family says he went there often with friends. Security footage provided by the casino shows Max, 25, arriving around 1:00 a.m. A Curry County Sheriff’s Office press release says Max was then seen going outside the casino and waiting near the back door. Around 1:50 a.m., security footage shows Max talking to a white adult male in front of the casino. Max and the man are then seen walking south across the parking lot, parallel to Highway 101, until they go off camera, still walking south. Eighteen minutes later, the man re-enters the casino alone. In a statement to authorities, the man said he and Max “went separate ways after leaving the casino.” Police told Dateline in 2018 that after conducting numerous interviews and searches they have suspects in the case but are not publicly releasing their names. Authorities say foul play is suspected and Max’s case is being treated as a homicide investigation. Since the casino is in Del Norte County, Curry County investigators handed the case over to the Del Norte County Sheriff’s Office once it was determined that’s where Max was last seen. In December 2021, NBC affiliate KOBI-TV <a href=#>reported</a> that the Del Norte County Sheriff's Office announced it “anticipates significant progress" in the investigation into Max’s disappearance based on new information and potential evidence. Dateline reached out to the sheriff’s office to confirm but has not yet heard back.

In July 2021, Larry Millete was named a “person of interest” in the case. He denied any involvement in his wife’s disappearance. By October, he had been arrested and charged with her murder. At a <a href=#>press conference</a> on October 20, 2021, authorities released details alleging that Larry Millete used a black Lexus to transport Maya’s body on January 8, 2021. The last recorded activity on Maya’s phone was on January 8. San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan revealed that Maya had scheduled an appointment with a divorce lawyer on January 12, but never made it. The D.A. noted that in 2020 Larry Millete had been visiting “spellcasters” — people purporting to wield magical powers of persuasion — in an effort to make Maya want to stay in the relationship. Larry Millete remains in the San Diego County Jail on no bond. In June of 2022, his defense attorney, Bonita Martinez, raised doubt as to her client’s competency to stand trial, which halted the criminal case. In September of 2022, San Diego Superior Court Judge Cindy Davis found that Millete is mentally competent. Millete is slated to have a three-week preliminary hearing, during which the prosecution will present evidence it believes will support the charges of murder and unlawful possession of an assault weapon filed against him. A date has not yet been set for the hearing. Maya’s family continues to hold prayer vigils online and in person. Her sister Maricris made a promise to Maya’s children: to find their mother’s body. If you have any information on the case or that can help locate Maya’s body, please call San Diego County Crime Stoppers at 888-580-8477, or CVPD at 619-691-5151.</p><p><strong>Michael Vanzandt</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Michael Vanzandt was last seen on the evening of March 5, 2016, while out in downtown Hermosa Beach, California.

He has not been seen or heard from since. An Air Force veteran and father of three, Michael was going through a divorce at the time, but family members said there were absolutely no red flags in his personal life that would have led to his disappearance. Because he was an avid swimmer, they fear he may have gone in the water for a late-night dip. However, none of Michael’s belongings were found on the beach. Authorities say the case is still active and ongoing.

On November 17, the 37-year-old called her sister Laura saying she was in distress and wanted to come home. Laura told Dateline that after a few days of not hearing from her sister, she began to call Nancy’s boyfriend. On November 22, the boyfriend reported Nancy missing. According to police, he said that he had dropped Nancy off at a shopping mall outside El Centro, California while he was finishing deliveries and Nancy was not there when he returned. Shortly after Nancy disappeared, Dateline spoke with Detective Luis Hernandez of the El Centro Police Department. “We’ve talked to businesses in that area [of the shopping mall] where she was supposedly dropped off,” he said. “We passed out fliers, and put her on our El Centro Police Department Facebook page.

According to the Trinity County Sheriff’s Office, the 51-year-old was last seen on October 12, 2016, at the home she shared with her boyfriend. The details of what happened in the days leading up to her disappearance remain unclear. Dateline spoke with Stacey’s daughter Nicole Santos-Hammann in early 2017. She said her mother was usually in daily contact with family, as most of them lived in the Lewiston area. In fact, they’d all gotten together on October 2, to celebrate Stacey’s mother’s 74th birthday. But later that week, Nicole stopped hearing from her mother. Concern quickly grew, especially after news of Stacey’s grandmother’s death and no one could get ahold of her. “My grandmother called and said her phone was disconnected,” Nicole said. “I called and it was disconnected. So I drove up there. No one answered the door. I left a note asking that my mother call me – that it was urgent. I never got a call.” Nicole said the family reported Stacey missing on November 2, 2016. A Facebook page called ‘<a href=#>Help Find Stacey Smart</a>’ has been created for Stacey’s family and friends to post information about her case.

Jackson Miller, missing May 15, 2010, Cameron Remmer, missing October 6, 2011, Shawn Dickerson, missing December 2, 2011, Crishtian Hughes, missing February 7, 2013, and Sean Sidi, missing May 21, 2013, all vanished from various areas of San Francisco without a trace. On March 26, 2021, a possible sighting of Jackson Miller at a Target in Woodland, California shined a new light on the cases. A woman called the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office and reported that she had been approached by a man who identified himself as “Jackson” and stated he was a missing person and asked her for a ride.

The move, in part, was so she could finally be with her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Jeff Beier. The “always happy” 36-year-old had just graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a degree in Landscape Architecture, and she was excited to start a new career, her sister Marilyn told Dateline shortly after Charlene disappeared. After not hearing from their daughter for several days, Charlene’s parents reported her missing on July 8, 2016. In March of 2018, authorities concluded a search of a landfill north of Denver in connection with Charlene’s case and while they did not find her body, they did find some of her clothes and the body of a small dog wrapped in a red sweater believed to have belonged to Charlene’s missing Chihuahua, Toby. The dog had been decapitated. In June 2020, an Arapahoe County grand jury in Colorado indicted Jeff Beier for Charlene’s murder. According to the affidavit, investigators believe Beier dumped the items at Tower Landfill in Commerce City, Colorado on July 2, 2016. He is charged with first-degree murder, first-degree felony murder, sexual assault, two counts of tampering with evidence, third-degree assault and two counts of attempting to influence a public servant, by misleading authorities about Charlene’s disappearance. He is also charged with aggravated animal cruelty. Shortly after Charlene vanished, Beier moved to Russia, where he has been in custody since 2020 pending a decision on extradition. If convicted, he faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Charlene’s body has not been found.

The 21-year-old was two months pregnant with the couple's child, a reported stress point in the relationship. Video released by the Pueblo Police Department shows Schelling’s black 2011 Chevrolet Cruze parked in front of a Walmart store around noon the following day. The vehicle had been left there overnight. The next day at 7:20 a.m., an unidentified person can be seen getting into Schelling’s car and driving away. The car was found abandoned a week later at Saint Mary Corwin Medical Center. In November 2017, tips led police to conduct searches in several different areas of Pueblo in connection with Kelsie’s case, but authorities told Dateline they were unable to find anything of significance. On December 1, 2017, police arrested Donthe Lucas for the first-degree murder of Kelsie. Lucas pleaded not guilty. In March 2021, after just a few hours of deliberations, a Pueblo County jury found Donthe Lucas guilty of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In June 2022, Dateline <a href=#>featured Kelsie’s case</a> in the original Peacock TV series “The Last Day.” Police told Dateline they have searched multiple locations over the years, but have not found Kelsie’s body. According to the <a href=#>family’s website</a>, they are offering a $50,000 reward for “information leading to Kelsie's direct return or to her location."

The 21-year-old Dawsonville, Georgia mother was last seen in Hollywood, Florida, on July 25, 2020, driving a white mid-to-late ‘90s Chevy Silverado 3500 pickup truck with a red tailgate and a “Baby on Board” sign on the passenger window. On July 28, Leila’s pickup truck was found abandoned in a Walmart parking lot in Hollywood, two miles from where her son had been found. In August 2020, federal agents arrested Shannon Demar Ryan in Florida and charged him with kidnapping in connection with Leila’s disappearance. Shortly before Ryan’s arrest, he posted a video online discussing how he met up with Leila at a RaceTrac gas station in Hollywood on July 25 to buy her truck before her disappearance. According to the arrest affidavit provided to Dateline, Ryan told investigators he paid $3,000 to Leila for her truck and the three of them left in his 2004 Gold Lexus ES 330 to spend the day at Fort Lauderdale beach, leaving the truck behind. When they returned, he said he parked at the gas pumps at RaceTrac and told investigators that Leila and her son left in a dark sedan with several unknown men. He stated it was the last time he saw her. According to the affidavit, law enforcement reviewed the security footage from the RaceTrac gas station, which did not show Ryan’s car at the pumps as he described it, and did not show Leila leaving in a dark sedan. Investigators say a car resembling Ryan’s was spotted on security video in front of the apartment complex in Miramar just minutes before Leila’s son was found. On August 15, 2020 law enforcement officials searched Ryan’s Lexus and discovered a half-empty container of all-purpose cleaner with bleach, several black trash bags and a white powdery substance. In October 2020, the FBI in Miami searched the Monarch Hill Landfill in Pompano Beach, but did not release further details in the investigation, or how they were able to zero in on the landfill. “The FBI continues to actively pursue every lead related to this investigation,” the department said in a statement. “We are still seeking information about Leila Cavett’s disappearance.” Ryan is facing felony charges of second-degree murder, tampering with physical evidence and child neglect – all connected to Leila’s disappearance. Ryan has pleaded not guilty to all charges. He is being held at Broward County Jail without bond. The Broward County Clerk’s Office told Dateline in an email that Ryan has a court date set for December 16, 2022.

Kai went to his mother's house in Lahaina to sober up. According to Samantha, on May 7, Kai gave his mother his phone, told her "Happy Mother's Day" and left the house.

Several days after that, Mo's belongings were found just a few miles from her Maui, Hawaii home in a dumpster behind the Wailuku Community Center. On September 20, 2019, Brown was indicted by a grand jury for Mo’s murder. He pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. According to the <a href=#>Associated Press</a>, in October 2021, a judge denied a defense request to move his trial away from Maui. Defense attorney Gerald Johnson cited the need “to prevent jury contamination,” given the publicity generated during the search for Mo on Maui. Judge Peter Cahill decided there was no basis to move the trial. On August 25, 2022, Brown was found guilty. His sentencing has been <a href=#>delayed</a> until January 2023. Investigators with the Maui Police Department said that “despite a lengthy and detailed investigation,” Mo’s body has not been found. Mo’s family and friends created the ‘<a href=#>Mowatch</a>’ page dedicated to finding their lost loved one and helping other families of missing persons in Hawaii spread awareness.

In October 2015, the Nelson County Sheriff officially named Brooks Houck a suspect in Crystal’s disappearance. Houck's brother, who worked as a Bardstown police officer, was terminated from the department after officials say he interfered with the investigation into the case. Danny L.

No charges have been filed in connection with Crystal’s disappearance, but officials have said they believe Crystal is dead. In August 2020, the FBI took over as the lead agency in the investigation. More than 150 state and federal law enforcement officers arrived in Bardstown and executed new search warrants at several properties connected to Brooks Houck. In the summer of 2021, FBI agents began excavation efforts at a home in a subdivision built by Houck in Bardstown. In September 2021, the FBI announced in a tweet that it concluded those search efforts. According to the statement, several “items of interest” were sent to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, but the FBI has remained silent on the details of their findings.

Investigators conducted laboratory analysis of evidence that was submitted and a detailed review of electronic evidence, but said in an effort to not compromise the integrity of the ongoing investigation, more specific details could not be released. Authorities said they worked with the Kentucky State Police to try to triangulate cell phones to get a clear picture of people’s whereabouts at various time frames surrounding Samantha’s disappearance, but it has not led to her location. Police also say they have questioned both Samantha’s boyfriend, Rhen Hendrickson, and his father, Dusty, multiple times and both have passed polygraph tests. In 2020, the FBI and other outside agencies joined the investigation to help with interviewing and re-interviewing witnesses or persons of interest, conducting a detailed and methodical review of all electronic evidence, and laboratory analysis of evidence submitted. There have been no arrests or persons of interest named in connection to Samantha’s disappearance. As of November 2022, there have been no further updates but authorities say the case is still open and active. West Kentucky Crime Stoppers and Samantha’s family are offering a $5,000 reward to the person or persons who provide information to law enforcement that results in discovering Samantha’s location, or results in the arrest and conviction of the person or persons involved with her disappearance. Samantha is described as being 5’6” and weighs about 125 lbs. She has hazel eyes and blonde hair, and was last seen wearing gray sweatpants and a hoodie. She would be 29 years old today.

Akia’s family became alarmed when the 22-year-old failed to show up to her own baby shower on May 3. Calls to Akia went unanswered. Family members visited her apartment to find only a couple of dressers and her bed. They said it looked as if she had moved out. Akia, who was eight months into a high-risk pregnancy, then missed her next prenatal appointment. Authorities initially said they did not suspect foul play in connection with the disappearance but in 2018, they told Dateline they believed foul play was involved. More than 100 people were interviewed in connection with the case. In February of 2022, Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby held a press conference to announce the arrest of a suspect. Officers arrested Michael Robertson for the murder of Akia Eggleston and her unborn child. Robertson is the father of Akia's unborn child. The Baltimore State’s Attorney’s office released a full statement of probable cause which indicated that Akia is likely deceased. They also stated that Robertson faces “a maximum penalty of two life sentences in prison if found guilty of all charges which include two counts of First Degree Murder,” while also cautioning that “an arrest is not a finding of guilt. An individual charged is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at trial.”Detective Niki Fennoy from the Media Relations section of the Baltimore Police Department told Dateline that the "Akia Eggleston case is closed," despite her body having not been located.

Charisma Carucci told Dateline that her 23-year-old daughter had spent most of February in the hospital due to an infection that led to a medically-induced coma. While in the coma, Alasia suffered complications and the decision was made to amputate her hand. After the appointment to remove the stitches, Alasia went home with her boyfriend, and called her mother that evening to let her know how she was doing. When she didn’t hear from her daughter the next day, Charisma called Alasia’s boyfriend, Marlon Billingslea. She said Alasia didn’t have a phone of her own so she usually called Marlon’s phone when she needed to get in touch with her daughter. Charisma said when she spoke to Marlon he told her Alasia had left and that he didn’t know where she had gone. Marlon told Dateline it was the morning of March 11 when Alasia walked out of the house without any explanation of where she was going, despite him asking. He said he followed her, but eventually, let her be and returned home. Alasia is described by her family as bright and kind, someone who showed a lot of promise just a few years ago when she graduated a year early from high school and enrolled in a nursing program at a local college. Officer H. Mackson of the Detroit Police Department told Dateline in May of 2021, that they continue to follow up on any leads or tips that come in, but nothing has led them to Alasia. Mackson stressed that, at that point, they had no reason to believe foul play was involved, but encouraged anyone with information to call the police.

The next day, a close friend who went to check on her found Danielle’s black 2015 Jeep Renegade parked in its usual spot right outside the entrance to her apartment complex. Floyd Galloway Jr. has been charged with first-degree murder in her case. He has pleaded not guilty. Galloway is a former security guard at the MetLife building where Danielle worked at the time of her disappearance. Authorities searched Galloway’s residence three weeks after Danielle vanished. Floorboards, several pieces of carpet, a mattress, and Galloway’s car were removed from his home and sent for testing, according to police. A judge ruled there was enough evidence to proceed to trial after Oakland County Medical Examiner Dr. Ljubisa J. Dragovic testified that he came to the conclusion Danielle died of asphyxiation, even though her body has not been found. The trial was initially scheduled for early 2020, but was pushed back multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Oakland County Circuit Court files, Galloway's trial has been moved to March of 2023.

A witness told police he saw the 25-year-old mother being forced into a silver Chrysler minivan. Investigators found Jessica's cell phone, keys and purse inside the store. In September 2016, officials charged Jeffrey Willis with abduction and murder in relation to Jessica’s case. He pleaded not guilty. At the time he was facing charges for the April 2016 abduction of a teenager who ended up escaping. The teen led police to a van where, according to court testimony, investigators found bondage items and lists of women’s names and addresses. According to NBC affiliate WOOD-TV, investigators said they found a file labeled “VICS” (short for victims) that contained a folder labeled with the initials of a jogger named Rebekah Bletsch who had been found shot to death in 2014. The folder also contained a code for her date of death. In November 2017, Willis was convicted of first-degree premeditated murder in the Rebeka Bletch case. Police told WOOD-TV there was also a file bearing Jessica’s initials on Willis’s computer. On May 16, 2018, Willis was found guilty of Jessica’s kidnapping and murder. Willis is serving two life sentences: one for killing Jessica in 2013 and the other for killing Rebekah Bletsch. On December 3, 2019, Willis asked the Michigan Court of Appeals to grant him a new trial in Jessica’s murder, stating that some of the evidence that the jury saw in his trial should not have been admitted, according to WOOD-TV. The court agreed some evidence should have been excluded at trial, but said that didn’t outweigh other “strong untainted evidence” that showed Willis was responsible for Jessica’s death. On December 27, 2019, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled that Willis’s arguments had no merit and that his conviction for Jessica’s kidnapping and murder would stand. Jessica’s body has not been found. Lieutenant Marc Vanderstelt of the Norton Shores Police Department confirmed that officials have still not found Jessica's body. He said that while there are no active searches for Jessica’s body, they will still investigate any tips that may come in regarding the location of her remains. Lieutenant Vanderstelt urges anyone with information to contact the Norton Shores Police Department at (231) 733-2691 or the Silent Observer at (231) 722-7463.</p><p><strong>Steven Kraft</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>On the evening of February 15, 2001, 12-year-old Steven Kraft left his family’s home in Benton Township, Michigan to go outside with two of his dogs.

Benton Township Chief of Police Brian Smit told Dateline in early 2019 that Steven’s young age combined with a disappearance that happened nearly two decades ago has made it impossible to try to track him. Steven was last known to be wearing a blue-green Charlotte Hornets basketball team jacket, a tan and white striped t-shirt, tan parachute pants, and black boots. In 2022, Detective Mike DenDooven from the Benton Township Police Department informed Dateline that Steven's case is "still an active investigation" and that they are "still looking into leads when they are brought forward to us."

Brazier is the cousin Zion had gone to spend time with the night she went missing. He originally denied seeing Zion that night, but weeks later admitted that he had thrown her body into a dumpster. He claimed that Zion had stopped breathing while they were smoking marijuana, and he didn’t know what to do. In March, <a href=#>Brazier was sentenced</a> to 23 months to 4 years in prison for lying to police. Police spent months searching for Zion’s body in a Macomb County landfill.

She has not been active on any social media since, which is out of character for the teen. Detective Seaberg told Dateline in February 2022 that officials have conducted many searches for Nevaeh. “We did some ground searches, drone searches, and canine searches in the immediate area where she was last seen.” But they did not find anything of note.

Aneisah told Dateline she visited Wendy at her home in Mankato, Minnesota, the night before, on May 31, 2018. Aneisah said she left after Wendy’s boyfriend, Mohammed Bilal Chughtai, came home that night. A few days later, on Sunday, June 3, when Aneisah had not heard from her mother, she went to check on her.

Aneisah told Dateline in 2019 that her mother’s bank account was last accessed on May 30, 2018, and her phone has not been used since June 2, 2018. Investigators searched Wendy’s boyfriend’s car and the home but found no evidence of foul play at the time.

Her boyfriend, Jerry Wayne Baggett, told law enforcement officials that he and Jessica had launched the boat into the river near the County Road 46 bridge in the early morning hours of New Year’s Day. They were on the water for a couple of hours when Jessica reportedly got out of the boat and made her way toward the north river bank in the direction of State Highway 30. Her purse and car keys were left behind. Her cell phone was later turned in by an individual who stated that he had it because Jessica and Baggett had planned to call him on it to be picked up at the end of their boating trip that day. Jessica was reported missing by her boyfriend at 10:15 p.m. that evening. Due to flooding, initially only drones with thermal imaging cameras searched the river bottom between the Tallahatchie River and Highway 30. A Mississippi Highway Patrol helicopter searched the river and river bottom downstream from County Road 46. When the flood waters receded, divers searched the river but found nothing. On January 2, 2021, investigators found a single green rubber boot with the top cut off. Baggett had told authorities previously that Jessica had cut the top off of her boot because it was rubbing on her leg. A coat believed to be Jessica’s was also found near the boot. Sheriff Jimmy Edwards with the Union County Sheriff’s Office told Dateline that there is no evidence of foul play in Jessica's case at this time, but noted that his department recently met with the district attorney to go over the case. The case is considered active and officials still investigate any tips that come in. Jessica is described as being 5’4” tall, weighs 110-125 lbs., with blonde hair and green eyes.

Several days after the 26-year-old was last seen, her vehicle was found abandoned in a rural area not far from her last known whereabouts. Inside were a number of her valuable personal items, including her laptop. Her cell phone was found in a nearby field. There appeared to be a break in the case when police questioned one man following his arrest on unrelated misdemeanor charges. After searches of his home, no evidence was found linking him to the disappearance. However, authorities do consider him a person of interest, as he was the last person known to have seen Rebecca before she vanished. Seven years later, Rebecca's case is still open. In 2020, Rebecca’s family offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to her whereabouts. Rebecca is described as 5’6”, weighing 145 lbs., with blonde hair and green eyes.

Wade, then 38, had been honorably discharged after serving four years in the Marines, including in Afghanistan. Authorities told Dateline in 2017, that evidence has been sent to crime labs for analysis, but they would not provide details to protect the integrity of the investigation. Police say foul play is suspected and there are people of interest in the case, but their names have not been released to the public. Dateline has reached out to the detective on the case about updates and is waiting to hear back. Anyone who may have seen Wade that early morning, or have information regarding his whereabouts, is asked to call the Alamogordo Police Department at (575) 439-4300.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Audrey May Herron</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Around 11:00 p.m. on August 29, 2002, Audrey May Herron left work in Catskill, New York. She was supposed to pick her daughter up from her mother’s house the next day, but she never arrived. Police would later learn Audrey, then 31, had never made it home from work. Neither Audrey nor her car, a 1994 black Jeep Grand Cherokee, has been seen since. Authorities suspect foul play in Audrey’s disappearance, but add they don’t have evidence to prove that Audrey is either alive or dead. According to <a href=#>local coverage</a>, in May of 2022, New York State Police sent divers to search three bodies of water in Green County, including Catskill Creek but did not recover any further evidence. Dateline reached out to the state police in November of 2022 to learn what led to those areas being searched, but has not yet heard back.

According to Corinna’s Aunt, Julie Anne Becker-Calf, two months earlier, in July – just as the 19-year-old was set to finish high school – Corinna contacted her mother and said she had met somebody who could give her a place to stay in New York City. Corinna left for New York with just her cell phone, ID, and the clothes on her back. Corinna was in contact with family and friends throughout the summer of 2017. Then in August, according to Julie, Corinna’s mother, Sabina, got a letter in the mail from the New York Police Department, addressed to Corinna. “It was a copy of a letter of protection notifying her that the attacker was incarcerated,” Julie told Dateline. “Sabina freaked out, called the NYPD and said, ‘What is going on?’” When Sabina spoke to Corinna about the incident, Julia said Corinna downplayed it. But the family was worried and started looking through Corinna’s social media pages with the hope of gathering clues as to what she was doing in New York. Julie says the reality was immediately obvious to her. “I called Sabina and said, ‘Oh, my God. She’s prostituting’,” Julie said. “One and one was making two. Everything was coming together. If you were to scroll through her Facebook, it was, like, an advertisement. Julie said she contacted her niece and expressed her concern. “I said, ‘I know somebody hurt you’,” Julie told Dateline. “But that was it. That was the last communication I had with her.” Her family said they feared Corinna had been entered into a sex-trafficking ring against her will. In November of 2018, authorities announced the arrest of Ishi Woney, 23, for sex trafficking and other offenses involving the sexual exploitation of young women, including Corinna. A <a href=#>press release</a> at the time stated “Woney compelled his victim to engage in prostitution through force and coercion, and he used both this victim and Corinna Slusser, who has been missing since September 2017, in online advertisements promoting prostitution.” <a href=#>News4 New York reported</a> in 2018 that Ishi was charged with the use of an interstate facility to promote, manage, and carry on prostitution, sex trafficking by means of force, threats, fraud and coercion, and with violating the Mann Act after being arrested. On November 26, 2019, Woney was sentenced to federal prison on sex trafficking charges, according to a spokesperson with the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney’s Office. He confirmed that Corinna’s disappearance was mentioned publicly at the court proceedings. The NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information spokesperson told Dateline in an email that they do not know Corinna’s whereabouts, and that the investigation is active and ongoing. The NYPD describes Corinna as having blond hair and blue eyes. She weighed approximately 140 lbs. when she was last seen and is about 5'7". She also has a large black flower-type tattoo in the middle of her chest. Anyone with information about Corinna's disappearance is asked to call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or, for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).

The 25-year-old’s mother, who was visiting from Wyoming, told Dateline she last saw her daughter on Monday, September 17. They made plans to get together that Saturday. On September 19, Kassandra left the home where she was staying around 11:40 p.m., according to a press release from the New York Police Department. She never returned. According to her mother, Ingrid Santana, the cousin later reported that Kassandra had said she was going to meet up with an ex-boyfriend that night and if it got too late, she would come back in the morning. Ingrid told Dateline that security video shows Kassandra going downstairs, helping an elderly woman with groceries, and turning left at Melrose Avenue and East 161st Street. She was reported missing to the NYPD on September 22. The NYPD confirmed to Dateline in December 2020 that they spoke with the man Kassandra told her cousin she was going to go see, but would not comment further. They also declined to comment on whether foul play is suspected in the disappearance. The NYPD told Dateline in November 2022, that the investigation is active and ongoing. Kassandra is described as being 5'2", and weighing 130 lbs., with dark hair. She was last seen wearing a black leather jacket, blue jeans and black sneakers.

Elaine found Norine’s car in the parking lot. It was locked and there were Christmas presents, wrapped, in the back. Elaine told Dateline that John called police and they took down a missing persons report which began their investigation. John Brown told <a href=#>News 12 Long Island </a>that he believes his wife was murdered and has denied having anything to with his wife’s disappearance. No persons of interest or suspects have been named in the case. Dateline reached out to Nassau County Police in November 2022 for an update, but has not yet received a response.

The 46-year-old left for his job as a local electrician in the early morning hours and has not been seen since. Robert’s wife, Ida, recalled her last conversation with her husband was on the phone around 9:00 a.m. that day, when they discussed plans for Father's Day. His 2004 red Pontiac GTO car was discovered the following night at a nearby train station. According to Ida, the keys were not inside the car, and the driver’s seat was adjusted for someone much shorter than him. About a week after Robert’s disappearance, a neighbor discovered that his security camera captured footage of Robert's car pulling into the driveway of his home at about 2:40 p.m. the day he was last seen. The car remained there for 10 minutes. It is unclear who was driving the car. Ida Mayer is seen arriving home 10 minutes later. After the discovery of the footage, Robert’s wife said she searched their home for clues. She found his cell phone, wallet and about $300 cash in a drawer – all items she said had been with Robert on the morning of his disappearance. In 2017, authorities called the search for Robert Mayer an open and active investigation, but few clues have been found in the case.

In the time since, there have been few clues as to what may have happened. According to Sergeant Shane Robbins of the Boone Police Department, Martin, who was 19 at the time, vanished without his cell phone, tablet or computer. He did not have access to a vehicle, which made his disappearance all the more troubling to his family. In 2016, Police told Dateline that they did not suspect foul play at that point, but were concerned as it was “very out of character” for Martin to not be in contact with his loved ones. Dateline reached out to the Boone Police Department recently to see if there have been any further leads, but has not heard back. Thousands continue to follow the Facebook group ‘<a href=#>Help Find Martin Roberts</a>,’ where Martin’s family posts updates, and others share words of encouragement.

Indy, who suffers from multiple medical conditions and takes daily medication for seizures, found the group online. It claimed to be a spiritual and ritual abuse training conference.

A Union County Sheriff’s Office press release says witnesses saw her “leaving the plant in her white Honda of America uniform.” Patti, 29, had planned on going to Canada with her boyfriend for a week-long vacation. But her family grew concerned when she failed to pick her daughter up from her sister’s house after the vacation. When family and police spoke to the boyfriend to ask if he knew where Patti was, they say he denied having any relationship at all with her. Authorities say courts have since declared Patti legally dead. While no arrests have been made in connection to Patti’s disappearance and presumed death, her then-boyfriend is considered the primary suspect in the case.

Brittany told Dateline that a close friend who lived in Columbus, came by the hotel to hang out with them. A few hours later, around 8:30 p.m., the three left the hotel to walk around the shopping center. They were out until about 3:00 a.m. and took an Uber back to the hotel. Brittany told Dateline that’s when the evening changed. She said Tyler seemed frustrated and decided to take a walk. Around 4:10 a.m., about an hour after Tyler left for the walk, he called and said he was in a wooded area but that he saw the hotel and he would be back in a few minutes. Brittany said he sounded confused. She said he called again and then hung up, and when she called him back his phone was off. Tyler didn’t return the next morning, so Brittany called police and filed a missing persons report. Detectives from the Columbus Police Department have conducted multiple searches of the area. In November 2022, Columbus State Police Detective Ron Groky told Dateline that Tyler was declared legally dead in 2021 but they still keep his case active.

Aubrey’s mother reported to police that she woke up around 3:30 a.m. and saw Aubrey leaving the house. Her purse and medication had been left behind. She was reported missing when she failed to answer calls or return home. Aubrey’s aunt and uncle, Pam Smith and Christian Fencer, told Dateline they found out from a friend on Saturday, March 16, 2019, that Aubrey was missing. They fear that as a transgender Native American woman, their niece may have been the victim of a hate crime. The family has found national support from Indigenous groups who have joined them in raising awareness of Aubrey’s case. Aubrey's case originally belonged to the Delaware County Sheriff's Office, but in July 2020, the Supreme Court issued a ruling regarding Native American reservations which meant the case would now be investigated by tribal police and the FBI. Both agencies have more resources than the sheriff's office. Shannon Buhl, Director of the Cherokee Nation Marshal Service, told Dateline his team has had to make up for lost time in what his office is investigating as a homicide. In 2022, Aubrey's case was featured in season one of the new podcast series “<a href=#>Dateline: Missing in America</a>.” Shannon Buhl, Pam Smith and Christian Fencer spoke with Andrea Canning. Aubrey is described as being 5’10” and weighing about 150 lbs. She has two tattoos: a triquetra symbol on her back and the word “Shorty” on her upper left arm.

Her sister, Justice Lindsey, told Dateline in 2019 that she received texts from Faith’s boyfriend stating that he couldn’t find her. A short time later, she received text messages from Faith’s phone she said were misspelled and did not make any sense. Faith was reported missing by family members on November 4, 2019. In December 2019, the Del City Police arrested Tanner Washington on a first-degree murder charge in connection with Faith’s disappearance. According to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI), the state charges were dismissed due to the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in McGirt v. Oklahoma which says that Oklahoma authorities cannot arrest or prosecute anyone involved in a crime on reservation land, and tribal authorities cannot arrest or prosecute crimes committed by non-tribal members. However, a federal indictment for murder was returned for Washington after the federal grand jury in Muskogee completed its May 2021 session. According to <a href=#>Oklahoma’s News 4</a>, Tanner Washington pleaded guilty to second-degree murder on October 31, 2022. They reported that court records revealed blood samples “discovered on the carpet of the back seat and on a set of sunglasses” in Washington’s old car were found to be “a biological match” to Faith. The investigation is still open and ongoing as the OSBI works to locate Faith’s body. They are offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to her location.

But they ended up at Knight’s father’s house in Michigan. Nieko's phone pinged for the last time at 5:05 p.m. on October 1, from Flintlock Drive in Franklin, Tennessee. He was never heard from again. Robert Knight died of a possible overdose in Michigan about 10 days after Nieko disappeared. For years, Nieko’s mother, Monica Button, continued to conduct her own investigation into her son’s disappearance, but his case seemingly went cold until the summer of 2016 when New York State Police investigators and Franklin Police Department detectives got a break in the case. The dismantled and stripped down 2004 GMC pickup truck Nieko had been traveling in was found stored in a residential detached garage in Nashville. In October 2017, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations (TBI) took over as the lead agency and in 2020 released a video stating they believe there are people who know how the truck got to the garage and possibly know what happened to Nieko. Last week, Monica Button was notified by law enforcement that a hunter found human remains near the location where Nieko was last believed to be. While Monica was hopeful the remains belonged to her son, she was notified over the weekend that the remains did not belong to her son. “To say that I am crushed is an understatement,” she wrote on the ‘<a href=#>Search for Nieko Lisi</a>’ Facebook page. “I want to bring my son home where he belongs. I was really hoping this was going to be it.” The identity of the remains found has not yet been released. In addition to the Facebook page, the family also runs a <a href=#>website</a> to provide information and updates in the case. A $30,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to Nieko’s whereabouts. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigations PIO Susan Niland told Dateline in December of 2022, that they are in contact with Nieko’s mother regularly and their department will investigate any tips called in about his case. Nieko is described as 5’10”, weighing about 165 lbs., with a muscular build. He has brown hair and eyes and has an unfinished tattoo of a guardian angel on his left side, and four Chinese symbols on the back of his upper right arm.

A little over an hour later, the 21-year-old’s wrecked vehicle was found abandoned on Salt Flat Road in Luling, Texas. The lights were on, the keys were in the ignition and the front passenger side door was locked. Jason’s backpack and clothes were found scattered on the roadway 900 feet away, but Jason was missing. Investigators say Jason was using the Waze app to get home, but opened Snapchat at one point and the GPS tracking stopped. He was last tracked driving on Austin Street and is believed to have gone through the intersection of U.S. Highway 183 or Magnolia Avenue and continued on East Austin Street. His digital footprint ends at this point. Detective Jeff Ferry with the Caldwell County Sheriff’s Office told Dateline that since Jason went missing, there have been at least six searches conducted spanning 31,000 acres. In November 2021, the detective said that there’s nothing to indicate that Jason was a victim of a crime and that it appears he was in a single car collision and walked away from the crash. Jason is described as being 6’1” and weighing 170 lbs. He has brown hair and eyes, and facial hair. Jeff Ferry, now captain at the Caldwell County Sheriff’s Office, confirmed in 2022 that Jason’s case is still open and active. He directs anyone with information about Jason’s disappearance to call the Caldwell County Sheriff's Office at 512-398-6777. You can also contact Capt.

She was reported missing after she failed to pick up her 6-year-old son from the babysitter’s house in Old East Dallas that evening. Lieutenant Stephen Biggs with the Mesquite Police Department told Dateline they've interviewed hundreds of people in the case, but are still at a loss as to what happened to Prisma. The 26-year-old left her job at a car dealership for lunch on April 17 and never returned. She was spotted having lunch with her ex-boyfriend at the E Bar Tex Mex restaurant located on North Haskell Avenue in Dallas. The man left, but police said Prisma stayed at the restaurant and continued drinking until she was asked to leave, according to police. Security video later showed her running into the garage of the Olympus at Ross apartments along Ross Avenue where her ex-boyfriend lived, but authorities learned he was not there at the time. Police told Dateline in 2019 that there was nothing that indicated foul play at the time, but they were concerned that no one had heard from Prisma in months. In November 2022, Lieutenant Brandon Ricketts of the Mesquite Police Department told Dateline that Prisma's case is still open, although "I don't think anything is actively being looked into, at this time," he said. He told Dateline that all leads have been exhausted but if new leads come in, the Mesquite police will investigate. Prisma is described as 5’2” and weighs around 135 lbs. She has brown hair and eyes.

The 21-year-old, who was assigned to D Battery, 1-43rd Air Defense Artillery Regiment, 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, 32nd Army Air Missile Defense Command, was initially reported AWOL after he failed to report for duty the next day. It wasn’t until day 36 – more than a month after Richard was last seen – that his parents, Robert and Patricia Halliday, were made aware that he was missing. Patricia told Dateline they called Richard’s commander at Fort Bliss to find out why they hadn’t heard from their son and were told he went AWOL. Major General Bernabe told Dateline that mistakes were made in the early stages of the investigation, including failing to contact the Halliday family when Richard went missing. On September 1, 2020, CID special agents assumed the investigation from the Fort Bliss Directorate of Emergency Services after assistance was requested. In 2021, the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command completed 65 subpoenas and conducted five search warrants in an effort to find Richard, according to a press release from Fort Bliss. In 2022, the U.S. Army <a href=#>increased the reward</a> from $25,000 to $50,000 for credible information leading to Richard’s whereabouts. The family created the Facebook page ‘<a href=#>Find Richard Halliday</a>’ in the hope of collecting information that could lead to their son. There, they <a href=#>posted</a> that “the reward was doubled from $50k to $100,000.00 by a private US business group, mostly owned by Veterans.” According to recent posts, the entire reward amount is now for $150,000. It is unclear who is offering the additional $50,000. Richard is described as being 5’9” and weighing 162 lbs., with black hair and brown eyes. Anyone with information on Richard’s case is asked to call the Fort Bliss CID Office at 915-568-1700 or the Fort Bliss Military Police at 915-744-1237.

Dylan apparently said he had to hang up because it was raining and he needed to move equipment on his farm. In 2019, Dylan purchased a farm in Lucin, Utah with his paternal grandfather. Lucin is right on the Utah/Nevada border and Dylan lived alone on the property in a camper. Two days after that phone call with his grandmother, Dylan’s mother reported him missing. Candice told Dateline her son’s truck and the boots he always wore were found on his farm. On July 7, 2022, the Box Elder County Sheriff’s Office announced that 58-year-old James Brenner is considered a suspect in Dylan's disappearance. Dateline spoke with Box Elder County Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Cade Palmer who said that Dylan and James Brenner are "probably each other's closest neighbor, which was maybe 5 miles apart." Palmer would not expand on the evidence that led officials to name Brenner a suspect, but did say that they have collected "substantial evidence" and "it seems like every bit of good evidence that we find points more at Brenner." The chief deputy told Dateline that while searching for Dylan, officials found evidence that supported the fact that "a homicide likely occurred." Palmer added that Brenner is not talking to law enforcement about Dylan's disappearance at this time. Dateline reached out to Brenner’s attorney for comment but has not yet heard back. A reward totaling $200,000 is being offered for information directly leading to Dylan’s safe return or the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for his disappearance.

According to the bar manager, the 43-year-old consumed a “couple of drinks” and watched a band play. A 2014 press release from the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office states that Claudine was last seen by a witness who said she was being helped out of the bar by her male acquaintance, James Todd Kessler. Kessler was the last person to see Claudine before she disappeared. After police investigated Kessler's home, traces of Claudine's blood were found, and he was charged in connection with her death. In August of 2015, a jury found Kessler guilty of second-degree murder and concealment of a body. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison for Claudine's murder. In December 2016, the Virginia Court of Appeals denied his appeal.

She never returned. Two days after Janet disappeared, police found her car abandoned about 20 miles from the house. Police say nothing was out of the ordinary with the car. Bloodhounds and cadaver dogs have searched both Renee’s home and the area near where her car was located, but nothing of significance has been found. Friends and family say Renee, who was 49 years old at the time, was a very private person who didn’t have any social media accounts, making her more difficult for investigators to track. Captain David Wells with the Fluvanna County Sheriff’s Office told Dateline in 2018 that authorities have investigated every lead they’ve received to try to locate Renee. Earlier this year, the Virginia State Police launched a website to display their <a href=#>database of cold cases</a>. It includes investigations into homicides and missing or unidentified persons cases that have been unsolved for at least five years. The Fluvanna County Sheriff's Office submitted <a href=#>Janet's case</a> to the database, which confirms it is still an active investigation.

Keeshae said she’d be home the following day. She never came home. Her friends would later tell authorities they dropped Keeshae off that night in the Church Hill neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia, about 10 minutes away from her house. Keeshae said she was going to meet someone, the friends told Toni, but they didn’t know who the person was. Despite searches, police have not found Keeshae’s cell phone, ID, or the small bag of clothes she had with her for her overnight stay. Authorities suspect foul play in Keeshae’s disappearance. The last public statement about Keeshae's case by the Richmond Police Department was on September 26, 2018 -- two years after Keeshae vanished. The police chief at that time was quoted in a press release: “Keeshae’s disappearance remains an active investigation within the Richmond Police Department. The detectives have made good progress in this case, but we are still hoping to get more information to get the family the answers they need.” In August 2022, Dateline featured Keeshae's case in our new podcast series “<a href=#>Dateline: Missing in America</a>.” Josh Mankiewicz spoke with Keeshae’s mother, Toni, and Natalie Wilson, co-founder of The Black & Missing Foundation.

Earlier that month, Sage, whose given name was Dashad, came out as transgender and changed her gender to “female” on Facebook. According to a 2016 press release from the Charlottesville Police Department, the 19-year-old and a man named Erik McFadden had planned to meet on the evening of November 20, 2012. McFadden later told authorities “the meeting never took place.” Police said that a detective made brief contact with McFadden immediately after Sage’s disappearance, “but [he] failed to show up to a scheduled interview with police and reportedly left town.” The Charlottesville Police Department has asked for the public’s help in locating Erik McFadden, whom police have identified as a “critical person of interest” in what they believe Sage’s homicide. In 2019, former Charlottesville Police Captain Jim Mooney said at a press conference that local and federal agencies have spent “countless months and hours” scouring through evidence, interviews and witness statements. Last year, Charlottesville Police Sergeant Tony Newberry stressed to Dateline that even though there have been no recent updates, it remains an active investigation and the department has “dedicated resources to the case so it can be worked full-time.” According to a Charlottesville <a href=#>press release</a> from 2020, “a $10,000 reward is being offered through Crime Stoppers, and an additional $10,000 is being matched by the City of Charlottesville for information leading to an arrest in Smith’s case.” Last month on the 10-year anniversary of Sage’s disappearance, a <a href=#>post</a> on the ‘<a href=#>Hope for Sage Smith</a>’ Facebook page noted the lack of answers in Sage’s case and paid tribute to her. “Today and every day,” the post stated, “we remember Sage and the love and joy that she brought to her family and friends.” Sage is described as being 5’11” and weighing about 130 lbs.

The 19-year-old told her brother she was leaving, but didn’t say where she was going. Orange Police say Samantha didn’t take any personal belongings with her and hasn’t been heard from since. The police previously told Dateline that foul play is suspected in Samantha’s disappearance and a detective was actively working on her case. In January 2021, it was announced that Samantha’s case would be reclassified as a homicide. “Due to new information and advances in investigative and forensic technology,” OPD Chief James Fenwick said, “ Samantha’s missing person investigation has been reclassified as an active abduction and murder investigation.” There have been no updates since, but police are hopeful someone will come forward with information. If you have any information that can help Samantha’s case, please contact the Orange Police Department at (540) 672-1491.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><strong>Deanne Hastings</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Deanne Hastings left her fiancé a note on the night of November 3, 2015, saying she was headed to the store. She never returned. The 35-year-old had finished her first day of cosmetology school that afternoon. The following morning, her credit card was used at a store not too far from her home outside Spokane, Washington. Security video shows Deanne leaving that store around noon. Her car was later discovered parked in downtown Spokane, and it appeared to have been there since November 3. In February of 2016, a man was arrested and charged with using Deanne’s credit cards. He spent several months in jail and was released in September 2016. Neither he, nor anyone else, has been charged in connection with Deanne’s disappearance, however. As of November 2022, there are no new updates in Deanne's case. Deanne is 5’4”, with brown hair and brown eyes. She would be 42 years old today. If you have any information regarding Deanne’s case, please call the Spokane Police Department at (509) 456-2233.</p><p><strong>Jeremiah Foco</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Software engineer Jeremiah Foco was last seen on July 22, 2015, in Seattle, Washington. Security footage shows the 34-year-old pulling into the garage of his apartment complex in Seattle's International District at 12:07 a.m., but there is no video of him leaving the complex. Seattle police do not suspect foul play, but family and friends insist Jeremiah would not just simply disappear. There have been few clues as to what may have happened to him. In November 2022, the Seattle Police Department told Dateline that Jeremiah is still considered a missing person. Jeremiah Foco is described as 6'2", weighing 220 lbs., with brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing tan shorts, a green shirt with yellow writing on the front, a red baseball cap, white socks, and sandals. Jeremiah would be 41 years old today.

She was seen again with the same man at 7:30 p.m. at the Chevron gas station next to the Swinomish Lodge & Casino. She hasn’t been seen since. Laynee’s sister-in-law, Emily Pepper, told Dateline that the man stated he had picked Laynee up and they went to a nearby campground where he had been staying. He reportedly then dropped Laynee off between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. at Causland Memorial Park, about two blocks from her motel. Emily told Dateline that on September 13, Laynee’s mother, Barb, got a call from the motel. They were trying to reach Laynee because she hadn’t paid rent and no one had seen or heard from her in several days. When the family couldn’t reach Laynee themselves, her mother reported her missing to the Anacortes Police Department. In 2021, Anacortes Police Captain Dave Floyd told Dateline he couldn’t elaborate on some of the details of what happened on September 10, 2020, but confirmed that there has been no activity on Laynee’s cell phone or her bank account since she used her debit card on the day she was last seen. He added that his department had “multiple law enforcement resources within the state'' assisting in the investigation. In November 2022, a detective with the department told Dateline the case was still "very, very active." Laynee is described as being 5’9”, weighing 120 lbs., with brown hair and hazel eyes. She was last seen wearing a black shirt, blue jeans and white sandals. Her dog, Precious, a rat terrier with a nub tail, disappeared at the same time. A $10,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to finding Laynee. Anyone with information on her whereabouts is asked to call Anacortes Police at 360-293-4684 during business hours or the APD tip line at 360-299-1985. The case number is 20-A06084.</p><p><strong>Logan Schiendelman</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>On May 20, 2016, 19-year-old Logan Schiendelman’s black 1996 Chrysler Sebring convertible was found abandoned on Interstate 5 between Tumwater and Maytown, Washington, one day after he was last seen at his parents’ home. Several drivers called 911 to report the vehicle on the shoulder and seeing a man, described as white with light brown or red hair, jumping out and running into the woods. In 2018, a woman came forward saying she thought she saw two men in the back seat with a man matching Logan’s description. The Thurston County Sheriff’s Office has received many tips regarding potential sightings, as well as where remains may be located, but there have been no concrete leads in the case. More than 15,000 people are part of the Facebook group ‘<a href=#>Logan Schiendelman is Missing</a>’ and family members continue to post periodic updates on the case. Foul play has not been ruled out in the case, and Logan’s loved ones say they cannot imagine that he would run away. There is currently a $10,000 reward for information leading to his whereabouts. Logan is described as 6’, weighing roughly 150 lbs., with black hair and brown eyes. He would be 26 years old today. If you have any information regarding Logan’s case, please call Det.

On August 1, 2018, the 28-year-old decided to go on a hike by herself, as she often did. She planned to summit Vesper Peak in Washington’s North Cascades, a route she’d taken before. She told family she’d be gone from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Witnesses would later tell police they saw Samantha at the summit around 3:00 p.m. that day. She never returned to her car at the base of the mountain. Since then, dozens of search and rescue teams have scoured the surrounding mountain ranges in the hope of finding Samantha. Authorities previously told Dateline no evidence has been found in Samantha’s disappearance and while her case is an active missing persons case, they do not have any reason to believe it is suspicious in any way.

According to his older sister, Brittany, after helping his mother carry some things from the car to the house, Michael ran behind the house without saying where he was going.

Irene is originally from Kenya but at the time was living with her boyfriend, Nathan Hightman, in Wyoming. Irene’s brother Christopher told Dateline he received an odd text from his sister in the beginning of March. Irene told Christopher she wanted to change her number because her phone was broken.n Christopher said he also found it strange that Irene was texting him in English -- because they usually texted each other in their native Swahili. Irene was reported missing in March 2022. Two months later, on May 10, the Gillette Police Department announced that Irene’s boyfriend, Nathan Hightman, had been arrested and charged with felony theft, unlawful use of a credit card, and crimes against intellectual property. The announcement stated that Irene was the victim of those crimes. It also referred to Hightman as a person of interest in Irene’s disappearance. Hightman has pleaded not guilty to the theft charges and is out on bond awaiting trial. He has not been charged in connection with Irene’s disappearance. Gillette detectives are requesting information regarding a 55-gallon metal drum, which may have been burned or abandoned in rural Campbell County. They are also asking for any information concerning a gray or silver-colored Subaru Crosstrek with Idaho license plates that may have been in the same area between February 24, 2022, and March 20, 2022.
