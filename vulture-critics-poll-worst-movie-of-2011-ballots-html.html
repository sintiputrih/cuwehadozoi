Those donkey teeth … that falsetto bray … Is there anyone more repulsive — anyone who could make us miss Dudley Moore more — than Russell Brand in his career-killing performance? I’d see <i>Jack and Jill</i> twice more rather than rewatch the <i>first scene</i> of this ghoulishly terrible remake, the worst movie of the year. You notice I left <i>Jack and Jill</i> off my list because it’s too easy. It was awful but there won’t be a legacy of awfulness in its wake, as there will be in all these other cases.<i><br>Shame</i>. Watching Carey Mulligan slowly torture “New York, New York” to death, I passed the time writing my Opposite World review: “Mulligan strips away the song’s facile optimism and lays bare her heartbreaking need for affirmation. Devastating!” Most hilarious moment: Michael Fassbender’s silent scream of despair in mid-orgy. <i><br>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides</i>. Endless, pointless, rudderless. You will not spend a two duller hours.<i><br>The Undefeated</i>. A clamorous, two-hour hagiography/infomercial that opens with a series of degenerate celebrities making vulgar remarks about Sarah Palin followed by a shot of her as an angelic little girl in a church choir. Riotous! Then the movie goes downhill.<i><br>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</i>. It took me a while to reach the active loathing stage, first because I cried — it’s not easy to steel oneself against phone calls from the World Trade Center on 9/11 — and second because I respected (if didn’t particularly like) Jonathan Safran Foer’s novel, in which he attempts to link his own pet themes to America’s worst terrorist attack. But in conclusion, this is a vomitous movie using a largely irrelevant story of a boy’s search for his father’s last message for specious uplift. Yuck. Gross. Horrible.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f16e600b45373ec86d7a4ace473de8a1-12-0-0@published data-word-count=211><b>Jim Emerson, Chicago<i> Sun-Times</i></b><i><br>We Need to Talk About Kevin</i>. I consider myself fortunate that I no longer have to see (or review) most of the bad movies that routinely pass through the multiplexes each week on their way to ancillary markets. No <i>Jack and Jill</i> for me. I’ve always found bad comedies and bad “art house” pictures to be the most painful to sit through, and <i>What’s the Matter With Helen, Kevin?</i> is a hoot, because it tries so very, very hard. I’m not sure what it’s trying to do, but it really works at it. Is it an unbearably arty horror film? A parody of “Bad Seed” movies in the broad style of Mel Brooks? A parody of sixties Antonioni movies as imagined by Dario Argento? Another take on <i>Mommie Dearest</i>? There’s a hilarious <i>Rosemary’s Baby</i> black stroller for the evil child, a pediatrician’s office with faded pictures of killer clowns, an entire wall of tomato soup cans (hommage de Warhol?), little sis bound and gagged with garlands (“We’re playing Christmas Kidnapping!”), a guinea pig and a garbage disposal, William Tell archery practice that you know cannot turn out well … and more red than Sugarpuss O’Shea’s sore throat.

Steve McQueen’s tale of pursuit-of-sexual-gratification-as-stations-of-the-cross punished its hollow shell of a protagonist (a too-game Michael Fassbender) as much as it flattered its audience by making them feel superior to him. Its acclaim isn’t mind-boggling only because it’s so clearly calibrated — in artful composition, self-serious score — to make you think you’re watching something of import. It’s actually childish, chastising, moralizing drivel so histrionic it has its main character literally wailing on his knees in front of the New York City skyline at the end. Nice dick, though.<br>2. <i>Crazy, Stupid, Love</i>. This preposterous, cliché-riddled, singularly unfunny studio product got really good reviews by otherwise sensible critics — which made me wonder if I was born into the wrong species, let alone profession. Color me confused: No one in this film acts in any recognizably human way — not Steve Carell’s rote doofus dad; not Ryan Gosling’s pickup artist, who seemingly has endless amounts of free time to waste on strange middle-aged male sadsacks he meets in bars; not the teen girl who takes nude photos of herself for her middle-aged crush; and certainly not the obnoxious preteen whose crush on said babysitter is presented as an example of soulful romanticism we can all learn from. It’s all almost as gag-inducing as the improper punctuation of the title.<br>3. <i>J. Edgar</i>. A cagey, enervatingly time-jumping script can barely hide the utterly unconvincing performance at its center. Leonardo DiCaprio — who really needs to get himself a romantic comedy, pronto — scowls from under mounds of bad latex, talks strangely like a cartoon JFK, has to contend with Judi Dench (doing a mean Mrs. Bates), and coyly holds hands with poor, struggling Armie Hammer, whose aging makeup as lifelong partner Clyde Tolson makes him a dead ringer for Donald Moffat. Whatever (simplistic) insights the film might have had about the connection between Hoover’s sexual repression and his tireless battle against the red phantom are unrecognizable beneath all the camp.<br>4. <i>Tanner Hall</i>. The long-awaited debut film from co-directors Tatiana von Fürstenberg (yes, designer Diane’s daughter) and Francesca Gregorini (that’s <i>Countess</i> Francesca McKnight Donatella Romana Gregorini di Savignano di Romagna, to you) hit the festivals in 2009, and certainly could never have been released if not for then unknown lead Rooney Mara’s presence. But there we were in 2011, lucky enough to have a chance to see this inane exercise in its makers’ prep-school nostalgia disguised as a universal coming-of-age drama.<br>5. <i>New Year’s Eve</i>. It may seem pointless to waste a slot on a knowingly silly romantic comedy that no one expected to be more than a trashy lark. But at one point during the film — each successive subplot of which seemed on a mission to continually outdo the prior one in stupidity — I glanced around at the viewers in the packed theater, and they looked like they we were watching <i>Sophie’s Choice.</i></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f16e600b45373ec86d7a4ace473de8a1-20-0-0@published data-word-count=28><b>Mick LaSalle, <a href=#>San Francisco <i>Chronicle</i></a></b><br>1. <i>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows</i><br>2. <i>What’s Your Number?</i><br>3. <i>Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides</i><br>4. <i>Kung Fu Panda 2</i><br>5. <i>Happy Feet 2</i></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-f16e600b45373ec86d7a4ace473de8a1-21-0-0@published data-word-count=104><b>Kevin B.
