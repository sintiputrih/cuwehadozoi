Shaggy is a popular reggae artist who has released more than a dozen studio albums, including "Boombastic" (1995), the 6x Platinum "Hot Shot" (2000), and "Summer in Kingston" (2011). In 2018, he teamed up with <a href=# title="Sting Net Worth">Sting</a> for the album "44/876," which won a Grammy.

He was awarded a Jamaican Order of Distinction in 2007, receiving the rank of Commander.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Shaggy was born Orville Richard Burrell on October 22, 1968, in Kingston, Jamaica. His parents, Lorraine and Clinton, moved the family to Brooklyn, New York City, when Shaggy was 7 years old. He attended Erasmus Hall High and began taking singing lessons in 1987. The following year, he was discovered while singing with his friends on the streets of New York City. In 1988, Shaggy enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and earned the Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) of Field Artillery Cannon Crewman (0811). During the Persian Gulf War, he served in the 10th Marine Regiment with a Field Artillery Battery. Lance corporal was Shaggy's highest rank during his time in the military, but his rank was reduced twice. In a 2011 interview with the "Military Times," Shaggy stated, "My big problem was being AWOL. I was driving up to New York every weekend to do music. Sometimes I got back late. And I'm a guy with a big mouth, and I mouthed off a lot. So, you know, things like that will get you busted."</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Shaggy had his first hit in 1993 with "Oh Carolina," which reached the top 10 on the charts in the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.

Shaggy followed "Pure Pleasure" with 1994's "Original Doberman" and found more success with 1995's "Boombastic," which went Platinum in the U.S. The title track topped the "Billboard" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts as well as the charts in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K. Another single from the album, "In the Summertime" (featuring Rayvon), reached #1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and the Hot Rap Songs chart. He released the album "Midnite Lover" in 1997, and after he was dropped by Virgin Records two years later, he signed with DreamWorks Records (which was sold to Universal Music Group in 2003).</p><p>Shaggy released his fifth album, "Hot Shot," in 2000, and it was certified 3Ã— Platinum or higher in five countries. The singles "Angel" (featuring Rayvon) and "It Wasn't Me" (featuring Rikrok) both reached #1 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, and the "Billboard" Year-End charts ranked "Hot Shot" 2001's second most successful album. After the massive success of "Hot Shot," Shaggy released the albums "Lucky Day" (2002) and "Clothes Drop" (2005), and he performed the "Scooby-Doo" theme song, renamed "Shaggy, Where Are You?," on the soundtrack for the 2002 live-action feature film version of the cartoon.
