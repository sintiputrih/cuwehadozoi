Families have spent more time together than ever before, ours included - and that has been a good thing.</p><p id=ej69sSnaBXc3 data-wc=54>We all found homeschooling tough (and humbling!) and the restrictions have been tricky obviously but those things pale into insignificance when you remember the sacrifices so many unsung key worker and NHS heroes have shown selflessly every day for us. That's what I have realised the most. Who the real heroes in life are.</p><p id=eXdTJm9Nt330 data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Bear Grylls suffers life-threatening allergic reaction to bee sting on set of Treasure Island</a></strong></p><p id=e8eS5C-n9ASJ data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>11 of the most Instagrammable walks in the UK</a></strong></p><h2>Are your sons taking after you career-wise? What do they think of your job?</h2><p id=eQoMY0nsipDt data-wc=51>All the boys are so different, and like all teenagers, they change their mind pretty often, but they have a great spirit and have grown up to love the outdoors. Scouts has been amazing like that for so many families. Encouraging friendships and a respect for nature. Those things are important.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6aeddb59c004-bear-grylls-crouch-by-tree-z.jpg><p id=eAKZbeodTswM data-wc=11><strong>The thrill-seeking adventurer will be at Gone Wild Festival this summer</strong></p><h2>Where are you hoping to go on holiday? Do you enjoy experiencing five-star luxury from time to time?</h2><p id=evMnYSYqUM46 data-wc=59>I can't wait to get back to our family home on our little island in North Wales. We have no mains electricity or water and run everything totally off-grid, but we love it. Our three boys, Shara and I are happier there than anywhere else on earth - adventure and solitude mixed with fun and family. My happy place.</p><p id=efjFoUkxBzml data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Holiday panic setting in? 6 available UK getaways for a last-minute staycation</a></strong></p><p id=eXR6hbtORlMI data-wc=1><strong>DISCOVER: <a class=hm-link href=#>Backpacking for beginners – the ultimate guide</a></strong></p><h2>After a tough day, how do you like to unwind?</h2><p id=e0hvVsLaUStc data-wc=85>It's not all mud and action, I love nothing more than a long bath with a huge mug of tea. The best. What's the most disgusting thing you've ever eaten? That's a long list- from frozen yak eyeballs in Siberia, to bear poo in Transylvania, camel intestinal fluids in the Sahara, rat brain in the south American jungles and snakeskin urine in Mexican desert - all were low points. But then no one ever said that either survival tastes great and or is ever easy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ef76036ec19b-bear-grylls-jumping-z.jpg><p id=ecMMwjslBuxg data-wc=9><strong>The TV star is known for his groundbreaking documentaries</strong></p><h2>Where's your dream post-COVID bucket list?</h2><p id=eWUSF4PAa--W data-wc=29>I would love to back to Nepal and show the family the mighty Himalayas and Everest from the bottom, that's been a dream of mine for some time now.</p><h2>What can we expect from Gone Wild Festival?</h2><p id=eXmi9R5tGrAo data-wc=46>It's going to be the ultimate family adventure, where you can go quad biking, wild swimming, climbing, learn cool survival skills and chill out with friends and watch some of the world’s best brands. It's the festival I always wished existed when I was growing up!</p><h2>After a year in lockdown, how can festival-goers slowly immerse themselves into thrill-seeking activities?</h2><p id=ePFANgR13qim data-wc=81>I think we all feel a bit like we've missed out on so much fun over the past year and Gone Wild aims to put the fun back into you and your families life. All of us, on our team and the Royal Marine Charity, believe this is going to be the perfect way for so many to end the summer before the kids go back to school. Just trust me on this one... Gone Wild is going to be epic!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/be3b1b5504e7-bear-grylls-full-body-z.jpg><p id=efsTrRjHv0Rd data-wc=17><strong>Bear became the youngest Briton to reach the summit of Mount Everest when he was just 23</strong></p><h2>Any motivational tips?</h2><p id=eGJt-qQllSDn data-wc=37>Life is all about grabbing opportunities and having that adventurous spirit when times get tough. I've learnt through this time to never take things for granted and that time spent with those we love together is everything.</p><h2>Do you have a mantra/life motto to get you through tough times in survival mode?</h2><p id=eHNnuioz95Hs data-wc=78>For sure. Life and the wild is all about resilience and positivity. Those things keep you alive sometimes. Even with the festival, there were times the Gone Wild team could have given up and thrown in the towel but they didn't. You have to admire that spirit when you see it and that is why I am so proud to be hosting this festival. If we can spread some Never Give Up vibes then that's a good thing.</p><p id=esyYZoC_NnVg data-wc=9>For more information on Gone Wild Festival, head to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>gonewildfestival.com</a></p><p id=e3OPrekCUzNQ data-wc=22><strong>Make sure you never miss a story! <a class=hm-link href=#>Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get all of our celebrity, royal and lifestyle news delivered directly to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSorJiav26tzZ1km5mSrnxzfJFqZ29oZGZ%2BdYKWb2abnZGneqi%2B2KWjrGWilr%2BmecWapKKkqWK2r7%2FIoJ%2BtZaees6Z50qGYq5ldqLyvv4yhnKWkn2Kyua%2FLrqqirpVk</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbear-grylls-rare-family-insight-wife-shara-sons-hello-exclusive.html&text=Bear%20Grylls%20shares%20rare%20details%20about%20wife%20Shara%20and%20sons%20-%20EXCLUSIVE&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbear-grylls-rare-family-insight-wife-shara-sons-hello-exclusive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbear-grylls-rare-family-insight-wife-shara-sons-hello-exclusive.html&title=Bear%20Grylls%20shares%20rare%20details%20about%20wife%20Shara%20and%20sons%20-%20EXCLUSIVE" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbear-grylls-rare-family-insight-wife-shara-sons-hello-exclusive.html&title=Bear%20Grylls%20shares%20rare%20details%20about%20wife%20Shara%20and%20sons%20-%20EXCLUSIVE" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbear-grylls-rare-family-insight-wife-shara-sons-hello-exclusive.html&title=Bear%20Grylls%20shares%20rare%20details%20about%20wife%20Shara%20and%20sons%20-%20EXCLUSIVE" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbear-grylls-rare-family-insight-wife-shara-sons-hello-exclusive.html&description=Bear%20Grylls%20shares%20rare%20details%20about%20wife%20Shara%20and%20sons%20-%20EXCLUSIVE" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-many-episodes-and-seasons-does-band-of-brothers-have.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How many episodes and seasons does Band of Brothers have?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bad-bunny-dating-history-kendall-jenner-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bad Bunny's dating history: from Kendall Jenner to long-time girlfriend Gabriela Berlingeri">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
