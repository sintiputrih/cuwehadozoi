He was admitted to the hospital just last week. Let’s have a look at his health difficulties.</p><h2 id=matt-lanter-in-hospital-for-surgery-what-is-through-the-ringer-meaning>Matt Lanter In Hospital For Surgery – What Is Through The Ringer Meaning?</h2><p>Angela mentioned that Matt Lanter is in the hospital for surgery, and he went through the ringer. The phrase “Through The Ringer” confuses many to understand what that means.</p><p>It probably means Lanter went through a series of difficulties and unpleasant experiences. It is an idiom used to express the series of troubles in between. We hope, there won’t be many challenges anymore.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>BREAKING 90210 actor Matt Lanter rushed to hospital as wife asks for prayers <a href=#>https://t.co/sIoY3TCz67</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/08jZALmQ9e</a></p><p>— Mirror Breaking News (@MirrorBreaking_) <a href=#>March 27, 2022</a></p><p>Matt was born on 1 April 1983 in Massillon, Ohio. He attended the University of Georgia majoring in business. He grew up with his sister. In 2004, he was a contestant on Bravo’s reality show Manhunt.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-matt-lanter>What Happened To Matt Lanter?</h2><p>No resources and his wife Angela have spoken on what had happened to Matt Lanter. But she posted the picture of them holding hands. Matt had tubes and tapes on his arm and a hospital wristband.</p><p>If he is hospitalized for surgery there must be something major, and the post of Angela gives us a sense of a real emergency. Angela probably will explain once she put herself together.</p><p>Matt got married to Angela Stacy on June 14, 2013, who was his long-term girlfriend. The two were in a relationship since 2009. They have got a daughter together born in 2017.</p><h2 id=know-matt-lanter-illness-and-sickness>Know Matt Lanter Illness And Sickness</h2><p>Matt Lanter’s illness of sickness was never revealed earlier till his wife posted about it on her Instagram.
