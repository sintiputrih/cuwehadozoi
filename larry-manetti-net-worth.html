Ed O`Connor in the film “Cool Money” (2005), among other roles. He has been an active member of the entertainment industry since 1973.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Larry Manetti is, as of late 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Larry`s net worth is as high as $2 million, earned through his successful career in the entertainment industry, during which he has appeared in many TV and film titles, winning the Hero Award for his work on “Magnum P.I.”.</p><h3>Larry Manetti Net Worth $2 Million</h3><p>Growing up in Chicago wasn`t quite from the books for Larry; in numerous interviews he stated that he had seen both sides of Chicago, the good and the bad, which only helped him in his later career, incorporating what he learnt into his acting. He wasn`t quite an honorable student, but found his way with the Ted List Players in his hometown, and was mentored by Golden Globe Award-nominated actor Robert Conrad.</p><p>Larry made his debut in 1973, with a brief role in the film “The Girl Most Likely to…”, and continued with small roles in TV series, including <a href=#>Jack Webb</a>`s “Chase” in 1974. His first bigger role came in 1976 when he was selected to portray Lt. Bob Boyle in the TV series “Black Sheep Squadron” (1976-1978), and the following year he appeared next to his mentor <a href=#>Robert Conrad</a> in the film “Sudden Death”, directed by Eddie Romero. Before the end of `70s, Larry also had a role in “Battlestar Galactica” (1978), as Giles. It was in 1980 that his life turned for the better, when he was selected for the role of Rick Wright, next to <a href=#>Tom Selleck</a> in the TV crime action adventure series “Magnum P.I.” (1980-1988), created by <a href=#>Donald P. Bellisario</a> and <a href=#>Glen A. Larson</a>. The role celebrated him as an actor, and increased his net worth by a large margin. While the show lasted, he wasn`t looking for other roles, and remained focused until its end. His next role was in the 1990 film “The Take”, and he continued through the `90s with roles in low budget movies, such as “CIA II: Target Alexa” (1993), “Subliminal Seduction” (1996), “Top of the World” (1997), starring <a href=#>Peter Weller</a>, “Scar City” (1998), with <a href=#>Stephen Baldwin</a>, and “Hijack” (1999), with <a href=#>Jeff Fahey</a>.</p><p>Larry is active as actor even today, and with the beginning of `00s, he had several notable roles, including in films “Random Acts” (2001) next to Victoria Foyt, “The Stoneman” (2002), “Cool Money” in 2005 alongside <a href=#>James Marsters</a> and John Cassini, and “Sinatra Club” in 2010.</p><p>Also, since 2013 he has appeared in six episode of the TV series “Hawaii Five-0” (2013-2016), as Nicky “The Kid” Demarco”, which has also improved his wealth.</p><p>Larry is also recognized as an author; he wrote and published the semi-autobiography, “Aloha Magnum” in 1999, which depicts time spent while shooting the popular series. Sales of the book also contributed to his net worth.</p><p>To speak further of his accomplishments away from acting, Larry also owned a restaurant at the Plaza Hotel & Casino.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Larry has been married to Nancy DeCarl since 1980; the couple has one child together, Lorenzo Manetti, a writer and director.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.279026217228><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Larry Manetti</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 23, 1947</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Chicago, Illinois, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 7" (1.7 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Nancy DeCarl Manetti</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Lorenzo Manetti</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0542027/</a></td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>TV Land Hero Award</td></tr><tr readability=15><td>Movies</td><td>Magnum, P.I., Cool Money, CIA II: Target Alexa, Body Chemistry 4: Full Exposure, Two-Minute Warning, Baa Baa Black Sheep, Monster Makers, No Tomorrow, Snapdragon, The Last Siege: Never Surrender, Sudden Death</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>TV Shows</td><td>Magnum, P.I., Baa Baa Black Sheep, The Duke</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=62.690850277264><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=10.421052631579><td>1</td><td>[Of <a href=#>Julie London</a>]: She was no doubt, platinum, everybody loved Julie London!

I went to the concert, and when we were talking with Elvis, I hit the button - and it lit up - and he went bonkers, and all he knew was he had to have that watch, and he was peeling off his rings, his pendants, everything and I said, 'I can't do it,' and Conrad was becoming very annoyed also cause he said, 'Manetti, too, give me a break, will you, it's only a watch by Elvis Presley.' I said, 'I can't, that's my friend, I'm too loyal to him,' cause he was ticked off and stormed off, but that was my encounter with Elvis, after that, we were fine.</td></tr><tr readability=10.808823529412><td>6</td><td>[When he heard NBC was going to turn <a href=#>Robert Conrad</a>'s, <a href=#>Black Sheep Squadron</a> (1976), TV series into a character-driven comedy program]: That was a big push from the star of the show, Robert Conrad. There were some groups at the time, I don't know if it was the P.T.A. or whoever, was giving us a hard time because of the violence of the show. Conrad wanted to add some softness in, so he brought in the nurses and <a href=#>Red West</a>, who was a friend of his and also <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a>'s bodyguard. I think it added to the show and brought a little more spice.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>7</td><td>It bothered me at first.
