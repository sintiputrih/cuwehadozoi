Before Lil Scrappy was born, Darryl Sr. left the family. In California, Scrappy went to a military high school.<br>Moving on to his romantic life, Scrappy started dating Erica Dixon, with whom he raised a daughter named Emani. Later on, though, the couple split up.</p><h2><strong>Net worth</strong></h2><p>Little Snappy initially gained notoriety as an American rapper/artist with a net worth estimated to be $1 million as of 2022–2023. This rapper has established his worth in the industry by working as a hip-hop artist, rapper, and even a performer of dirty Gänga rap. Little’s wonderful creation is that. Love & Hip Hop: Tlanta (also known as LL) quickly emerged as the highest-rated section of the Love & Hip Hop organization. This is actually the method that has helped to increase Little’s net worth.</p><h2><strong>About His Personal Life</strong></h2><p>From 2008 to 2011, Lil’ Scrappy and Diamond Carpentero were engaged.
