She is best known as one of the eight main cast members in the MTV reality series Jersey Shore.</span></p><p><span>She was born on 14 March 1987 in Hazlet, New Jersey. This year, in 2021, she celebrated her 34th&nbsp;birthday. Giancola is of Italian and Greek descent. She has significantly gained fame from playing several TV reality shows and some films.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Sammi Giancola Splits From Her Fiance, Christian Biscardi</strong></span></h2><p><span>Sammi Giancola, who featured in the reality series Jersey Shore left in 2012, said the environment was toxic.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, she wished the cast members of the series the best, and she was staying in a happy relationship with her boyfriend, Christian Biscardi.</span></p><p><span>However, it seems that the pair is&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>no longer together</a>. Having been engaged to Christian for more than two years, the reality series actress sparked breakup rumors with her fiancé after they <a href=# rel=noopener>were caught unfollowing</a> each other on Instagram.</span></p><p><span>Biscardi has also deleted all photos of his fiancée from his Instagram. The Jersey Shore star's last photo with Biscardi dates back to March 2020. Apparently, all other photos with Biscardi have been deleted from her social media posts lately, and mention of him has been removed from her bio on Instagram.</span></p><p><span>The last mention of Biscardi on Giancola’s YouTube account was from December 2020, when she shared a video of their favorite holiday traditions. But, the outlets and public have yet to hear from the subjects of the topic themselves.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Sammi Giancola Relationship With Boyfriend Christian Biscardi</strong></span></h2><p><span>Sammi Giancola began dating Christian Biscardi in 2017 and got engaged in 2019. Giancola first announced the engagement news on Instagram in March 2019 with a photo of Biscardi on a bent knee as he slid a ring onto her finger. She <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned</a>: <strong>“I’m completely overwhelmed with happiness. Yesterday was the best day of my life! I get to marry my other half, best friend and soulmate. I look forward to spending the rest of my life with you @_biscardi I love you!! #Fiance #MrsBiscardi #Stillcryingtearsofhappinnes.”</strong></span></p><p><span>Biscardi commented on her post,<strong> “I love you, and I’m equally thrilled that no one is going to tell me to put a ring on it 76,000 times a day!”</strong></span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/uploads/sammi-giancola-with-her-fiance-christian-biscardi.jpg alt="sammi giancola with her fiance christian biscardi" width=650 height=478 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Sammi Giancola with her fiance, Christian Biscardi (©: People.com)</strong></span></p><p><span>A year later, in March of 2020, she told followers that she had said “yes” to a wedding dress. While she remained silent to reveal any more than this, she later took to a YouTube video showing fans inside the boutique and interviewing Castle Couture’s Bridal Manager to give women tips for finding the perfect dress for their big day.</span></p><p><span>Her one of the most recent post hinting her marriage was in early May of 2021, as she shared a photo in which she wore a lace and tulle wedding dress leaning against a white limo giving a pose. She captioned the picture, <strong>“Don’t worry… this cake was in good hands,”</strong> while tagging a bridal shop, hair and makeup, team, limo company, bakery, and even a wedding planner in her post.</span></p><p><span>Over the last year, there has been a lot of speculation about who Giancola would invite to her wedding. But now, some of her co-stars from Jersey Shore confirmed not having received any invitations to Giancola’s big day.</span></p><p><span>In April 2020, during an interview with In Touch, Giancola’s former co-stars Jenni “JWoww” Farley, Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi, and Deena Cortese discussed their lack of connection with their former roommate. And they gave their own reasons from their perspective as of why they were not given the invitation for the wedding. And same goes for Vinny Guadagnino and Pauly DelVecchio, Us Weekly reported in April 2019. However, despite their disconnection, all of them still wished Giancola all the best with her fiancé.</span></p><p><span>Though they planned to wed in 2020, they <a href=# rel=noopener>postponed</a> it to September.&nbsp;Before their wedding plans, Sammi would often share her selfies with the fans on Instagram, and it seemed that no one appreciated them more than Christian. Christian would usually leave a comment of love and admiration for his bride-to-be.</span></p><p><span>But after this recent hint sparked among the public by them through their social media, the pair doesn’t seem to be as lovey-dovey as before. There is also some speculation on the internet of them parting ways having ended their relationship. However, the news has yet to be confirmed by the pair themselves.</span></p><p><span>Prior to Christian, Sammi dated Michael Sorrentino briefly in 2009 and moved on to date Ronnie Magro afterward, till 2016. Meanwhile, her relationship with Ronnie was quite the tumultuous one as the fans were even given a glimpse of it in the reality series Jersey Shore.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Net Worth Of Sammi Giancola</strong></span></h2><p><span>Sammi Giancola has amassed a huge net worth with her works in television reality series, films, and other business ventures. She has an estimated <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of $4 million as of 2020.</span></p><p><span>She was one of the main cast members in the MTV reality series Jersey Shore but later left with no intention to return announcing on her Instagram. While her time on Jersey Shore, she <a href=# rel=noopener>earned</a> $80,000 per episode during the beginning, and it later was upped to $150,000 per episode.</span></p><p><span>Her role on the original Jersey Shore, her fashion business, and her work on the Just Sayin’ podcast contributed to her wealth. She also did modeling along the line and also started a new business venture, Sweetheart Styles, which has made her worth more than any other cast members on the Jersey Shore even after she left the series. It was not only earning and spending for Sammi, as she also managed to invest and save throughout her career that helped her accumulate such wealth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In 2012, Sammi appeared in the slapstick comedy film, The Three Stooges. But, after&nbsp;Jersey Shore, Sammi seems to be more into the entrepreneurship works as she launched her own business venture in 2013 named&nbsp;Sweetheart Styles.</span></p><p><span>The businesswoman stands at the height of 5 ft 5 in and weighs around 56 kg. She has quite the athletic build as she played softball, ran track, and played in the high school soccer team in her schooling years. Sammi also had a keen interest in art and won several contests related to it while growing up.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46smKalmWK0qq3NnKalmV2btqK6wp5knqaXlrSmsIynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMoZyin5ip</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsammi-giancola-fiance-engaged-net-worth-height.html&text=%27Jersey%20Shore%27%20Star%20Sammi%20Giancola%20Splits%20From%20Her%20Fiance%2c%20Christian%20Biscardi&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsammi-giancola-fiance-engaged-net-worth-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsammi-giancola-fiance-engaged-net-worth-height.html&title=%27Jersey%20Shore%27%20Star%20Sammi%20Giancola%20Splits%20From%20Her%20Fiance%2c%20Christian%20Biscardi" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsammi-giancola-fiance-engaged-net-worth-height.html&title=%27Jersey%20Shore%27%20Star%20Sammi%20Giancola%20Splits%20From%20Her%20Fiance%2c%20Christian%20Biscardi" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsammi-giancola-fiance-engaged-net-worth-height.html&title=%27Jersey%20Shore%27%20Star%20Sammi%20Giancola%20Splits%20From%20Her%20Fiance%2c%20Christian%20Biscardi" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsammi-giancola-fiance-engaged-net-worth-height.html&description=%27Jersey%20Shore%27%20Star%20Sammi%20Giancola%20Splits%20From%20Her%20Fiance%2c%20Christian%20Biscardi" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./austin-ekeler-girlfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All About Austin Ekeler Girlfriend [2023 Update]">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./and-just-like-that-documentary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Whoa, Che Diaz Was Not Supposed to Be Miranda's Love Interest in 'And Just Like That...'!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
