The men were released on remission after 14 years of jail time as the district jail advisory committee cited their good behavior and the years they have served.</span></p><p><span>“This is a message to all seeking justice that you have to have good legal support,” New Delhi-based lawyer Mehmood Pracha told </span><span>Al Jazeera</span><span>. “Unless you have a good legal team and you are determined to fight for your rights, getting justice especially under the current regime is becoming more and more difficult.”</span></p><p><span>Many other lawyers and activists continue to question the court’s decision and criticize the Indian government.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“[The victim] and other survivors should be allowed to live in peace and dignity,” Maimoona Mollah of AIDWA </span><span>said</span><span> as their organization demanded the state to reverse its decision.</span></p><p><span>“How can justice for any woman end like this? I trusted the highest courts in our land. I trusted the system, and I was learning slowly to live with my trauma. The release of these convicts has taken from me my peace and shaken my faith in justice,” Bano </span><span>wrote</span><span> in a statement released on Wednesday.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“My sorrow and my wavering faith is not for myself alone but for every woman who is struggling for justice in courts,” she added. “No one enquired about my safety and well-being, before taking such a big and unjust decision. Give me back my right to live without fear and in peace.”</span></p><p><span>Featured Image via <span>Euronews</span></span></p><h3>Support our Journalism with a Contribution</h3><p>Many people might not know this, but despite our large and loyal following which we are immensely grateful for, NextShark is still a small bootstrapped startup that runs on no outside funding or loans.</p><p>Everything you see today is built on the backs of warriors who have sacrificed opportunities to help give Asians all over the world a bigger voice.</p><p>However, we still face many trials and tribulations in our industry, from figuring out the most sustainable business model for independent media companies to facing the current COVID-19 pandemic decimating advertising revenues across the board.</p><p>We hope you consider making a contribution so we can continue to provide you with quality content that informs, educates and inspires the Asian community.<br><span class=donate_way><strong>Even a $1 contribution goes a long way.</strong></span> Thank you for everyone’s support.
