He was widely known as “the town bully” in his hometown.</p><p>McElroy was accused of dozens of crimes throughout his life, including assault, child molestation, r*pe, arson, and animal cruelty. At the same time, his most mysterious case is the Bowenkamp murder case which is still unsolved.</p><p><strong>What events in his childhood persuaded him to become a criminal? Why did Ken Rex Murder Evelyn Sunny? What was behind the case? Let’s find out.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Made Ken Rex McElroy A Criminal?</h2><p>McElroy took his first breath in 1934 in the USA. He was raised in an impoverished family, and he had many siblings, in which McElroy came on the fifteenth number.</p><p>It is considered that the poor condition of the family unable to carry out basic home needs persuaded McElroy to continue with immoral and illegal activities.</p><p>He carried on with his studies and dropped out of school at age 15.</p><p>After this, he joined a local group of town and was known locally as a cattle rustler, small-time thief, and womanizer.&nbsp;</p><p>McElroy was accused of being involved in the theft of grain, gasoline, alcohol, antiques, and livestock for two decades.</p><p>Since his childhood, he grew himself in a very tyrant way and continued this till his death.</p><p>However, Ken was represented in front of defense attorney Richard Gene McFadin of Gallatin, Missouri,&nbsp; for his illegal activities and suspected crimes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened In The Murder Case Of Bowenkamp?</h2><p>In some of the reports, it is stated that McElroy killed the person due to random arguments of his child with clergy of a shop.</p><p>In 1980, one of his children got into an argument with a clerk, Evelyn Sumy, on trying to steal candy from the shop.</p><p>A grocery store was owned by 70-year-old Ernest “Bo” Bowenkamp and his wife, Lois.</p><p>McElroy’s child complained to his father for a random argument, and for this, he threatened the Bowenkamp family shot him in his hand at the back of his store.</p><p>At the same time, when they confronted each other, McElroy shot Bowenkamp in the neck.</p><p>Ho got severe injuries and went to the hospital. Luckily Bowenkamp survived, and the police arrested McElroy. He was charged with attempted murder.</p><p>The fact is that after some time of detention, McElroy was freed on bail on the appeal.</p><p>At the next moment of release, he went to the D&G Tavern, a local bar, with an M1 Garand rifle attached with a bayonet and made persistent threats for Bowenkamp.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Other Cases For Which Ken Rex McElroy Was Suspected?</h2><p>In 1973, McElroy was suspected of assault and r*pe. It was based on Trena’s story. But sadly to say, he was released on USD 2500 bail.</p><p>Trena and her baby were placed in foster care at home in Maryville, Missouri. McElroy sat outside the foster home for hours with his child, and he threatened the family to trade&nbsp; “girl for a girl.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Mysteriously Ken Rex McElroy Married To Trena MacCloud?&nbsp;</h2><p>He married Trena MacCloud in his hometown, and the couple was blessed with ten children.</p><p>In some of the reports, it is stated that when Trena was 12 years old and in eighth grade. McElroy r*ped McCloud many times, burnt her house down and shot the family dog in front of her parents. Trena’s parents reluctantly agreed on their marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>When she was 14 years old, Rex impregnated her, for which she had to leave her studies. After that, she went to live with McElroy and his second wife, Alice.&nbsp;</p><p>Sooner, McElroy divorced Alice and walked down an aisle with Trena to escape charges of statutory r*pe. Trena was the only witness for her r*pe case.</p><p>After the baby’s birth, Trena and Alice moved to Trena’s mother’s and stepfather’s house.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the reports, McElroy chased both of them and brought them back. He repeated the same scenario when they reached home,&nbsp; burnt the house, and shot the family dog of McElroy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Is His Net Worth?&nbsp;</h2><p>It was estimated that he had a net worth of USD 2 million at the time of death, which he acquired from his illegal and immoral activities.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When Did McEloruy Die?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>He indulged himself in foul and criminal activities throughout his life, and with the same pace of his so-called career, McElroy died on 10 July 1981 in Skidmore, Missouri, in the United States.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC3xKdkq52oYrqkscurprJlk5bApns%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fken-rex-mcelroy-case.html&text=Ken%20Rex%20McElroy%20%20What%20Happened%20In%20The%20Murder%20Case%20Of%20Bowenkamp%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fken-rex-mcelroy-case.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fken-rex-mcelroy-case.html&title=Ken%20Rex%20McElroy%20%20What%20Happened%20In%20The%20Murder%20Case%20Of%20Bowenkamp%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fken-rex-mcelroy-case.html&title=Ken%20Rex%20McElroy%20%20What%20Happened%20In%20The%20Murder%20Case%20Of%20Bowenkamp%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fken-rex-mcelroy-case.html&title=Ken%20Rex%20McElroy%20%20What%20Happened%20In%20The%20Murder%20Case%20Of%20Bowenkamp%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fken-rex-mcelroy-case.html&description=Ken%20Rex%20McElroy%20%20What%20Happened%20In%20The%20Murder%20Case%20Of%20Bowenkamp%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-radeon-r9-280x-review-feat-asus-xfx.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Launching This Week: Radeon R9 280X - The Radeon R9 280X Review: Feat.
