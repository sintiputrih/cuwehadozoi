Although the showrunner Derek Haas told Parade that there are “93 [FBI] offices in embassies and military bases around the world” ahead of the series premiere, the team primarily works out of the United States Embassy in Budapest. The 2nd season of the CBS show is almost close to the midseason fall finale, and we recently saw the appearance of Ken Dandridge, played by Michael Torpey, who had not appeared on the series since the last episode of Season 1.</p><p>In this article below, let’s learn more about the role that Michael plays in FBI: International plus his acting career, net worth, personal life, and more.</p><h3><strong>Michael Torpey On FBI: International</strong></h3><p>In the CBS show, the team of FBI Special Agents meets Michael’s character, Ken Dandrige, at the United States Embassy in Budapest. Ken is the legal attache at the embassy and holds a quite bit of power.</p><p>According to the Internet, the legal attache is someone who is responsible for: coordinating requests for FBI or host country assistance overseas, conducting investigations in coordination with the host government; sharing investigative leads and information, briefing embassy counterparts from other agencies, including law enforcement agencies, as appropriate, and ambassadors, managing country clearances, and other jobs.</p><p>When Ken appears on the screen, he is asked to monitor The Fly Team and is put on the Hutchinson case. In the finale of FBI: International Season 1, Ken was on the top of the team while they were investigating the death of an American model in Milan. He wanted visibility in the case, which really got under Special Agent Jamie Kellet’s (played by Heida Reed) skin.</p><h3><strong>Michael Torpey Movies And TV Shows</strong></h3><p>Michael is an actor and writer by profession. He is best known for his performances on Orange Is The New Black (played by CO Thomas Humphrey), VEEP, and Inside Amy Schumer.
