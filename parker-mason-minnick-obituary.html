How did he die?</span></h2><span>Parker Mason Minnick was called home to be with the Lord on Monday, August 14, 2023. His journey began on October 13, 2005, in Marshall, MO, as the cherished child of Ryan and Mindy (Bell) Minnick from Carrollton, MO.</span><p><span>At the age of 17, Parker embraced life with an undeniable passion. His infectious smile and warm handshake had the power to brighten anyone’s day. A true people person, he possessed the remarkable ability to form connections effortlessly. Fearless and full of courage, Parker’s heart overflowed with compassion for others. His quick wit, swift thinking, and delightful sense of humor were always a joy to those around him.</span></p><p><span>Parker was on the brink of entering his senior year at Carrollton High School, where he was destined to be a standout tri-sport athlete. His affinity for sports bloomed with his early proclamation of the word “ball.” Beyond his natural athletic prowess, he was a beacon of leadership. Just on the cusp of taking the helm as the returning quarterback for the Carrollton Trojans, Parker’s profound understanding of not only his role but also that of his teammates set him apart. In times of adversity, he was a wellspring of encouragement, always reminding his teammates to stay strong.</span></p><p><span>While his prowess extended to football and basketball, Parker’s heart truly belonged to baseball. His aspirations knew no bounds, and he was a goal-setter from a young age. He made a personal pact to himself: “Use every practice to improve and remain focused.” His dedication was unmistakable. A diligent student of the game, Parker honed his skills during the off-season, learned from his mistakes, and relentlessly pursued growth. When he wasn’t on the Trojan baseball field, he could be found with the PPA PRIME (Prieto’s Power Alley) showcase team, nurturing dreams of playing beyond high school. The recruitment process was an active pursuit, and he was well on his way to realizing his dream. The baseball diamond was his sanctuary, where he found genuine happiness.</span></p><a href=# data-slb-active=1 data-slb-asset=1359388618 data-slb-group=51226><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-51228 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/galaxylands.com.vn/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/parker-mason-minnick-obituary-4.jpg alt="Parker Mason Minnick passed away on Monday, August 14,, 2023." width=750 height=554 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p id=caption-attachment-51228 class=wp-caption-text><span>Parker Mason Minnick passed away on Monday, August 14,, 2023.</span></p><p><span>Parker’s team spirit extended beyond the sports arena. On weekends, he was a familiar face at Burger Bar and Dari Maid, serving the community with a smile that radiated joy even more than ice cream could. He approached his role not merely as a job but as an opportunity to bring happiness to others.</span></p><p><span>As he entered his senior year, Parker had his sights set on a career in Architectural Engineering. College visits had solidified his desire to graduate from K-State with a degree in Architectural Engineering, wearing the title of a proud Wildcat. This path was a reflection of his deep-rooted love for science and math. Problem-solving and crafting with his hands were passions that fueled him. A former member of the Happy Hustlers 4-H Club, he delved into Robotics and Junk Drawer Robotics, mastering the art of creating from scratch. His Lego constructions and whimsical marble runs were early signs of his creative flair. As he matured, he embraced every STEM opportunity at Carrollton High School. At home, he translated his creativity into the virtual realm of Minecraft, where his visions came to life.</span></p><p><span>Within the community, Parker assumed the role of a mentor through various workshops and clinics organized by the YMCA. He refereed YMCA soccer, basketball, and football matches, and he umpired for the Carroll County Little League, generously passing on his game insights to the next generation.</span></p><p><span>Parker was a devoted member of the Immanuel Lutheran Church, where he received his baptism and joined the Lord’s family. His unwavering faith led him to seek wisdom from Christ, and he approached the teachings of the Kingdom of Heaven with an inquisitive and open heart. This spiritual connection was truly a gift from the Holy Spirit. Parker’s profound faith and trust in his Creator were evident to his family, who recognized his wisdom. From a tender age, they were confident that he would someday be an instrument in bringing others to God’s kingdom.</span></p><p><span>Parker leaves behind his loving parents, Ryan and Mindy Minnick, along with his siblings, Bailey Minnick (partner Colton Stoner), and Corynn Minnick. His legacy continues through his nephew, Ryker Stoner. He is also survived by his grandparents: Debbie Minnick, and Kenny and Terry Bell, all hailing from Carrollton. Among his cherished relatives are his aunt and uncles, Brad (Heather) Minnick of Lawrence, Kansas, and Matt (Chayanne) Bell of Kansas City, Missouri. His cousins, Gannon and Bennett Minnick, hold a special place in his heart.</span></p><p><span>Parker was preceded in death by his grandfather, Roger Stanley Minnick, as well as his great-grandparents: Emmett “Pat” and Mary Martha Winfrey, Earl and Ethel (Lungren) Bell, William Clayton and Virginia (Clark) Hansel, and Randall and Melinda Elizabeth (Dryden) Minnick.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Parker Minnick Car Accident</strong></span></h2><p><span>It is with heavy hearts that we share the news of Parker Mason Minnick’s untimely departure on the somber day of August 14, 2023.
