Remember the cabbage soup diet? That one really sticks in my memory and I will never look at cabbage the same way after eating at least 7 bowls of cabbage soup a day while on that diet! Then we have seen Whole30, Atkins, low-fat, low-carb, and everything in between. It can be confusing because of so much information out there and we wonder what will work for us.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Have you ever been on a diet or cleanse and you feel like you’re constantly thinking about food and battling the urge to binge? If so, it is not a sustainable diet. It is when our hormones are balanced that our cravings go away and the tendency to overeat diminishes.</span></p><p><span>Since I am a food blogger, it is really hard for me to stick to a diet. I am constantly staring at food photos, creating recipes in my kitchen, and testing and re-testing recipes. I am constantly bombarded with food, <strong>so sticking to any long-term diet is a huge struggle</strong>. I always end up feeling frustrated and overwhelmed! If you are like me and love food as I do, diets can be extremely hard and rarely have long-lasting results.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kale-Salad-scaled.jpg alt="Intermittent Fasting Results.

It is great for weight loss without dieting. #fasting #fast #intermittentfasting #beforeandafter #diet" width=2560 height=1707 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span>I am also a book nerd.&nbsp; I love spending an afternoon in the library just perusing a gigantic stack of books…and after being diagnosed with several autoimmune diseases in 2010, I spent years researching health and wellness and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>learning how to heal my body through food, nutrition, herbs, and vitamins</span></a>. As much as I love cookies and cakes, I equally love food that is healthy and good for my body. I wanted to figure out a way that I could do both…eat the foods that I love but still lose weight.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I remember reading all about intermittent fasting and how many people found success when they got their bodies used to fasting. I was intrigued. And since I have tried just about everything else in the book, I thought….why not try intermittent fasting? I decided to go big or go home!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>My typical pre-intermittent fasting day would go something like this. When my four kids were in school, I would wake up at 5:45 am every single morning. This means I was likely eating breakfast at around 6:00 am. I usually fixed myself a smoothie or protein shake, but then I was hungry again by 9:00 am. I would then eat a snack, but was hungry and ready for lunch by 11:30 am. I would eat another snack around 2:00 pm and then dinner at 5:30 or 6:00. And we can’t even begin a discussion on how many days I am recipe testing, which basically means I am grazing all day long….followed by a little snack before going to bed. I was actually eating every 3-4 hours.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Summer-Fruit-Salad-with-Honey-Lime-Dressing-916-2-scaled.jpg alt="Intermittent Fasting Results. How I lost over 50 lbs. by following an intermittent fasting program. It is great for weight loss without dieting. #fasting #fast #intermittentfasting #beforeandafter #diet" width=2560 height=1707 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span>Since an intermittent fasting plan begins with allowing your body to be in a fasting mode for a longer period of time, I decided to condense my eating window to be around 6 hours…from about 11:30 am to 5:30 pm. This means that I would have lunch, a snack, and dinner during that period of time. So let’s do some math!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If I am skipping my typical breakfast at 6:00 am, my snack at 9:00 am, and my snack at 8:30 pm…those missing calories are adding up!&nbsp; They may equate to about 750 calories per day — and when you multiply that by 7 days in a week — it comes to 5,250 calories that I could eliminate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But if my “snacks” were more  like desserts, the calorie count could be more like 1000 calories per day. If you multiply that by 7 days in a week — it comes to a whopping 7,000 calories! It is estimated we need to burn about 3,500 calories in order to lose just one pound. So without changing anything else in my diet…just eliminating the extra eating….I figure it could possibly equate to a <strong>2-lb weight loss per week</strong>!&nbsp;</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chicken-Marinade.jpg alt="Intermittent Fasting Results.

What did I have to lose? Maybe my sanity because I love food…but I thought it was worth a shot! I decided to schedule all of my recipe testings during my eating window instead of testing during early morning hours or after dinner.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It was HARD. I am not going to sugar coat it and tell you it was a piece of cake…especially in the beginning. Your body has to adjust and get used to going without food. The intermittent fasting hunger was real! I was hungry and my husband would probably tell you I was a little HANGRY. Being a generally very happy person who loves food…it was really hard going without it!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But the <strong>good news is that it got MUCH easier in time</strong>! My body began to adjust and I became more accustomed to going to bed feeling a little bit hungry. I started sleeping better, as my body wasn’t busy digesting the ice cream I ate at 10:00 pm.</span></p><p><span>A huge difference was the <strong>change in my appetite</strong>. My stomach began to shrink and my body required less food in order to feel full and satisfied. When I would go out to eat, my husband was amazed at how quickly I became “full.” I started taking home a lot of leftovers because I couldn’t finish my meals. I was consuming less food but I was still feeling full and happy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Now let’s talk about my good news! <strong>Everyone wants to hear about RESULTS and the weight loss benefits</strong>. I was honestly shocked by how quickly the weight began to come off. I was losing weight every single week and my clothes began to feel loose on me. <strong>I lost over 50 LBS</strong>. just by following this intermittent fasting protocol!&nbsp;</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Dean-and-Melissa-California.jpg alt="Intermittent Fasting Results.

I realized I could do this for the rest of my life! &nbsp; However, after being on the “quarantine diet”…which includes baking up every carbohydrate known to man…I am finally very excited to be back on my fasting plan and to experience all of the benefits.</span></p><h2><b>What are the benefits of Intermittent Fasting?</b></h2><p><span>Intermittent fasting benefits are many.&nbsp; They can definitely include weight loss…but there are also many other amazing physiological changes like reduced inflammation, better sleep, gut reset, hormonal re-balancing, enhanced mood, and something really cool called autophagy, which is the body’s natural cleansing process. Scientists are actively studying the potential benefits for fasting and autophagy and the connection  between fasting and the potential benefits for fighting to fight against cancer, Alzheimer’s, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and many other diseases.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Healthy-Juice-Cleanse-Recipes-7-scaled.jpg alt="How to do a fasting cleanse.

The benefits of intermittent fasting. www.modernhoney.com #fastingcleanse #fasting #intermittentfasting" width=2560 height=1676 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><span>What is a fasting cleanse?</span></h2><p><span>Cleanses are all the rage, and for good reason – we eat a lot of processed food and yummy treats and feel the need to replenish our health. </span><span><a href=#><b>Juice cleanses</b></a></span><span> have been popular for years, but juice cleanses work differently than a fasting cleanse.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;In a </span><span><a href=#><b>juice cleanse</b></a></span><span> you’re filling your body full of vitamins and dense nutrients. Conversely, in a fasting cleanse, you’re trying to get into autophagy, where the body discards toxins that were held up in fat stores and discards old and damaged proteins to make way for rebuilding. To do this, you need to only give your body very specific micronutrients and macronutrients that keep insulin levels very low</span></p><p><span>One very important reason that fasting works unlike any “diet” is that fasting is the counterbalance to eating. It’s all about staying in balance, especially hormonal balance. The chief hormone among these is insulin. To put it simply, when insulin is high, we store energy.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When insulin is low for a long period of time we cleanse and rebalance. We miss out on this natural benefit of fasting because we tend to eat so frequently in our modern world. I’m not going to go into all the technicalities here, but you can read more about the benefits of fasting in a </span><b>30-day intermittent fasting plan</b><span> that I’ll talk more about below.</span></p><p><span>Fasting is the most powerful way to reduce insulin and other hormones that control hunger, so it is important that eating, and especially occasional indulgences, be offset by fasting. The best fasting programs also ensure you are eating the right foods when you DO eat, providing the right level of nutrition, and continuing to control hormone levels.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Overnight-Oats.jpg alt="Intermittent Fasting Results.

They are designed to fast.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Our bodies need space between refueling, and sometimes a longer space than just overnight. During extended times of not eating, we burn off food energy and begin to access fat stores.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>How does intermittent fasting work?</b></h2><p><span>There are many intermittent fasting plans out there and you can tailor make them to fit your lifestyle. Many people do the 16:8 plans which allow for an 8-hour window for eating. I found more success in the 18:6 plan which allows for an 6-hour eating window.</span></p><p><span>Another intermittent fasting strategy is to do one meal a day for 5 days. OMAD is just how it sounds – you only eat one meal, and no snacks (at least not your typical snacks). This allows for more fasting time to unleash more health benefits. The other two days are on the weekends and you can eat what you want. Now that sounds pretty heavenly!</span></p><h2><b>Products to help make Intermittent Fasting easier:</b></h2><p><span>There is something that helps me tremendously while I am fasting. It is a new product on the market and it is amazing! It is called FASTWELL. The </span><b>Fastwell Curb Wellness Shake&nbsp;</b><span>comes in two flavors — Madagascar Vanilla or Macadamia Chocolate and is perfect for me when I am struggling to make it through some fasting days. It’s called a “wellness shake” because it is </span><span>NOT</span><span> a “protein shake”. Protein shakes and bars will knock you right out of the fasted state. The Curb Wellness Shake is designed with a precise combination of macronutrients, ingredients, and calories to eliminate hunger cravings while </span><i><span>keeping you in the fasted state</span></i><span>. I usually drink it when I am heading somewhere where I know I may be tempted to eat. It helps to keep my cravings under control. </span><a href=#><b>Get Curb</b></a></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Intermittent-Fasting-Shake-Fastwell-1-scaled.jpg alt="Tips and tricks for helping with intermittent fasting.

So many times when we think we are hungry, it is our body’s way of telling us that we are actually thirsty. This electrolyte drink helps to keep me hydrated while fasting, without knocking me out of the fasting state. It is made with Real Salt brand sea salt, lightly sweetened with all-natural ultra low-carb sweeteners, this drink has a curiously amazing citrusy flavor. Start your day with this drink to ensure you’re well-hydrated at the beginning of the day – a major key to fasting success. </span><a href=#><b>Get Sustain</b></a></p><p><span>Can you exercise while fasting? If you have an exercise routine, be sure to keep it up during your fasting program. Working out during your fasting window can help maximize your workout and your fast. Boost is designed to give you just a little bit of energy and fuel for your muscles to support your fasted state workout while keeping you in the fasted state. </span><a href=#><b>Get Boost</b></a></p><p><span>Doing something hard is so much easier with the right tools!
