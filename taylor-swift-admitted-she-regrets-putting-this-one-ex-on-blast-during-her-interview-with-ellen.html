Swift's own personal songwriting has even come under fire for her allegedly using the lyrics to put her exes on blast.</p><p>However, it was one particular moment when Swift put an ex on blast that she later regretted. It was a moment stripped of any music or poetry, and it happened during an interview with <a href=#><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a>.</p><h2 id=taylor-told-ellen-degeneres-that-joe-jonas-broke-up-with-her-over-the-phone-in-25-seconds>Taylor Told Ellen DeGeneres That Joe Jonas Broke Up With Her Over The Phone In 25 Seconds</h2><p>Taylor Swift's relationship with Joe Jonas lasted from July 2008 to October 2008. The two denied their relationship at first, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with Swift insisting they were just friends</a>. However, speculation intensified when the two were photographed sitting together at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards. Swift also performed with The Jonas Brothers during their "Burnin' Up Tour."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift eventually confirmed the relationship after it ended. She told Ellen DeGeneres that her song "Forever & Always" was about Jonas. She also put the singer on blast and revealed the way he broke up with her.</p><p>"Some day, I'm gonna find somebody really, really, really great, who's right for me," Swift told DeGeneres. "When I find that person that is right for me, he'll be wonderful and when I look at that person, I'm not even gonna be able to remember the boy who broke up with me over the phone in 25 seconds when I was 18."</p><p>"Forever & Always" was included on Swift's "Fearless" album. She opened up to People about the song and its meaning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[It's] a song about watching somebody completely fade away in a relationship and wondering what you did wrong," she said.</p><p>Jonas responded to Swift's appearance days later on his MySpace page. He also denied rumors that he cheated on Swift with actress Camilla Belle.</p><p>Jonas wrote in part, "For those who have expressed concern over the '27 second' phone call, I called to discuss feelings with the other person. Those feelings were obviously not well received. I did not end the conversation. Someone else did. Phone calls can only last as long as the person on the other end of the line is willing to talk."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Travis Kelce Defends Taylor Swift Against NFL Haters As He Hints At Their Future Together">Travis Kelce Defends Taylor Swift Against NFL Haters As He Hints At Their Future Together</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Travis shared his thoughts on what's been dubbed the "Taylor Swift effect" on the NFL and how it's shaping his career.</p><p>In 2019, Swift made another appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and told the host she felt bad about what she said nearly a decade earlier.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Probably when I like, put Joe Jonas on blast on your show," Swift said when DeGeneres asked her the most rebellious thing she did as a teenager.

Although the singer was on the verge of becoming a huge star, she only appeared in one skit. Her main role that night was the musical guest.</p><p>In November of that year, Swift appeared on the show again, this time as the host. Her hosting duties are even more impressive when you consider that Swift herself was only 19 at the time. During her opening monologue, Swift sang a song referencing many of the things people have said about her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar52708695-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the song, Swift talked about writing songs about those who have wronged her, rumors of her dating Taylor Lautner, and her infamous run-in with Kanye West at the MTV Video Music Awards. She even mentioned her breakup with Jonas and her revelation on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.</p><p>"You might think I'd bring up Joe, that guy who broke up with me on the phone, but I'm not gonna mention him in my monologue," Swift sang during the song.

"Here's a 19-year-old who nobody is really helping out; nobody gave her a manual of how to do that show. And yet, she came to us and said, 'I wrote a song for the opening monologue.' So we brought Taylor into Lorne [Michaels, SNL creator]'s office, and she sings this song which is not only a beautiful song by a beautiful singer, it's a perfect SNL monologue.
