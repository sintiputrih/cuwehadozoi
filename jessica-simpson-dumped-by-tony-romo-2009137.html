She was supposed to celebrate with a Ken and Barbie-themed party. (On Simpson's birthday, Romo spent the night at Los Angeles hot spot My House.)</p><p>"She canceled her party because of this," the source tells <strong>Us</strong>. "She's doing OK."</p><p>"Barbie party didn't happen, but I turned 29 and feel like I am on top of the world yelling I LOVE GETTING OLDER!" she wrote on her Twitter page Saturday.</p><p>Later, she wrote: "Everyone needs to know that hope floats…grab the strings and pull it back to you… Falling asleep with my mom and the dogs. Please, Lord, give all of my beautiful fans, friends, enemies, and family rest. Bring all of us peace."</p><p>A close friend of Romo's tells <strong>Us</strong> of the split: "It's been a long time coming."</p><p>Still, another source tells <strong>Us</strong> the volatile couple could always get back together. "They go from one fight right into another, without a second break," the source tells <strong>Us</strong>. "It's always something with Jessica."</p><p>Simpson's rep had no comment. Simpson – who turned 29 July 10 – began dating Romo, 29, in November 2007 — around the two-year anniversary of her split with <strong>Nick Lachey</strong> (who, incidentally, recently split with his girlfriend <strong>Vanessa Minnillo</strong>).</p><p>Look back at Jessica Simpson's most unforgettable moments</p><p>Simpson said she was watching a Cowboys game with her family when a segment on the quarterback aired, during which he said Simpson was his celebrity dream crush.</p><p>"My family was like, 'Did you just hear that?'" Simpson told the June 2008 issue of Glamour. "His picture came up, and I'm like, 'He's really cute.' Then I heard [that I was his crush], and I'm like, 'Oh my gosh!'"</p><p>See photos of more celebs who have landed their crushes</p><p>They later met after a pal introduced Romo to her dad, Joe. Simpson said she and Romo then began flirting "over e-mail and on the phone."</p><p>On their first date, Simpson told Glamour, "I had butterflies that you would not imagine. I wanted to puke in the cup holder … It took me forever to put together an outfit!"</p><p>See Jessica Simpson's style hits — and misses!</p><p>He tried to kiss her on their first date. "I was taken aback….</p><p>"The fact that this guy, on our first date, in the first 10 minutes of dinner, wanted to lean over the table and say, 'This is my girl, and I want to kiss her' — our first kiss in front of everybody — was awesome," she recalled to Glamour.</p><p>During their relationship, Simpson credited Romo with helping her change as a person.</p><p>"He reintroduced me to myself," Simpson told Glamour. "I thought that I had to be deeper, more profound and more artsy. You change with the guys you date."</p><p>See every single Us Weekly cover Jessica Simpson has appeared on</p><p>"Tony taught me that because he loves me [as me]. He made me feel comfortable [being myself] again," she said.</p><p>(She even dedicated the tune "You're My Sunday" to the football star while recently touring.)</p><p>See Jessica Simpson and other stars who've engaged in major PDA!</p><p>Despite professing her love for Romo, their relationship underwent its share of scrutiny. Last year Simpson was nicknamed "Yoko Romo" by Cowboys fans who thought she was bad luck to Romo's football performance. Appearing on the Late Show With David Letterman, she even joked that she'll never again wear her pink No.9 jersey to games.</p><p>Look back at Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey's cheesiest moments</p><p>Simpson – who the subject of much debate after she showed off a fuller figure earlier this year – told this June's Vanity Fair that they didn't let the criticism get to them.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Look back at the many loves of Jessica and Ashlee Simpson</p><p>"We don't let it affect our relationship," she said. "If we did, we wouldn't be together, because it happened at the very beginning. Dating the Cowboys quarterback comes with hype, the fans, the bloggers, but I've never dated a guy that was more simple. I'm always there for him after a game, and he knows he has me to come home to."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnaOotqStjKygpqijpLtusNSmp56cXZfGbsDOp7Bmqp%2BivG5%2Bj2lwamtnZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137.html&text=Jessica%20Simpson%20Dumped%20by%20Tony%20Romo&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137.html&title=Jessica%20Simpson%20Dumped%20by%20Tony%20Romo" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137.html&title=Jessica%20Simpson%20Dumped%20by%20Tony%20Romo" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137.html&title=Jessica%20Simpson%20Dumped%20by%20Tony%20Romo" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjessica-simpson-dumped-by-tony-romo-2009137.html&description=Jessica%20Simpson%20Dumped%20by%20Tony%20Romo" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-liz-cambage-dating-now-a-look-into-the-wnba-stars-relationship-status-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Liz Cambage Dating Now?
