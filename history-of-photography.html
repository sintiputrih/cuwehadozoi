The photograph shows the view from his window in Saône-et-Loire, Bourgogne, France. It might not look like much, but it took eight hours to accomplish.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Photograph Ever [Enhanced] (1826 Or 1827)</h2><span class=caption-body>An enhanced version of Niépce's photograph, made in 1952 by Helmut Gersheim, who turned the thin little shadows that Niépce had captured into something a bit easier to make out.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Photograph From A Negative (1835)</h2><span class=caption-body>Niépce's photograph didn't look like much, but in 1835 in Wiltshire, England, Henry Fox Talbot had turned the idea into something a bit more practical. For the first time, he took a photo with a negative. Instead of imprinting one faint image onto metal, he could now use his negative to make as many copies as he wanted.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Photograph Of People (1838)</h2><span class=caption-body>Louis Daguerre took the first photograph ever to feature a human being. The photo is a street scene in Paris, but if you look closely at the bottom left, you can see two people, one presumably having his footwear polished by the other. Because they were still during the several-minutes exposure time, they were captured while all the moving traffic and people were not.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Selfie (1839)</h2><span class=caption-body>The first portrait ever taken just happens to have been a selfie. In 1839 in Philadelphia, Robert Cornelius became the first person patient enough to stay completely still in front of a camera for the 15 minutes it required to take a daguerreotype. All at once, this became the first clear photo of a person, the first portrait, and the first selfie in the history of photography.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Portrait Of A Woman (1839 Or 1840)</h2><span class=caption-body>Soon after Cornelius' achievement, John Draper became the first person to take a portrait of somebody else. This milestone, which occurred in New York City, marked the first time anybody ever took a portrait without pointing the camera directly at their own face — or, at least, the first time it came out as something you could actually see. Draper pointed his camera at his sister, Dorothy, creating the history of photography's first portrait of a woman.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Detailed Photograph Of The Moon (1840)</h2><span class=caption-body>While in New York, Draper also took the first clear photograph of space, namely the Moon.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Hoax Photograph (1840)</h2><span class=caption-body>Hippolyte Bayard made history as the first person to prove that, sometimes, photographs do lie. Bayard spent three years developing what he called the "direct positive process" of photography. He thought he'd make history when he unveiled it to the world — but instead, fellow Frenchman Louis Daguerre beat him to the punch and announced his daguerreotype method to the world. Bayard believed there'd been a conspiracy against him, and took this hoax photograph to try convince the world that, because of what they'd done to him, he'd drowned himself.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Presidential Portrait (1843)</h2><span class=caption-body>The first American president to be photographed was John Quincy Adams, captured by Philip Haas in Washington, D.C.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Photograph Of People Drinking (1844)</h2><span class=caption-body>David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson started Scotland's first photography studio and developed a reputation for making the first "action" photographs of everyday life. This photo, taken in Edinburgh, is the first to ever show people sharing a drink.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Photograph Of The Sun (1845)</h2><span class=caption-body>The first photograph of the Sun was taken by Léon Foucault and Hippolyte Fizeau in Paris.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First News Photograph (1848)</h2><span class=caption-body>Nobody knows who took this photo — the first in the history of photography ever used to illustrate a news story. Nevertheless, the photograph shows the Rue Saint-Maur-Popincourt in Paris, shortly after a battle between government forces and demonstrating workers. The road is full of barricades that were used in a battle that left thousands dead.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Color Photograph (1851)</h2><span class=caption-body>In 1851, Levi Hill of New York boasted to the world that he had taken the first ever color photograph by using his own process to create what he called "hillotypes." However, Hill was so protective of his methods that nobody believed he'd actually pulled it off. They called him a fraud, saying that he'd just painted over a black-and-white photograph. It took until 2010 before researchers were able to test his photos. He had touched them up a bit, but it turned out that Hill had been telling the truth — he really had taken the first photo with some color.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Aerial Photograph (1860)</h2><span class=caption-body>James Wallace Black titled the first aerial image in the history of photography "Boston, as the Eagle and the Wild Goose See It" — a view he captured by taking this photograph of his hometown from a hot air balloon. It's widely accepted that French photographer Gaspar Felix Tournachon actually took the first aerial photograph a couple of years before Black. Nadar's photos, though, have been lost to time.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Full-Color Photograph (1861)</h2><span class=caption-body>James Clerk Maxwell and Thomas Sutton created the first full-color photograph (depicting a tartan ribbon) in 1861 in London. Unlike Levi Hill's photograph, no part of this picture was touched-up by hand.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Full-Color Landscape Photograph (1877)</h2><span class=caption-body>Early color photography wasn't easy. It took another 16 years after Maxwell and Sutton before anyone took a full-color photo of a landscape. The man who pulled it off was Louis Ducos du Hauron with this image of Agen, France.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Photograph Of Motion (1878)</h2><span class=caption-body>Eadweard Muybridge used a dozen cameras all triggered one after another with a set of strings to take the first frame-by-frame photographs of motion. When viewed one after the other in sequence, Muybridge's photographs, taken in Palo Alto, California, would help inform the development of the first moving pictures.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>First Photograph Of A Tornado (1884)</h2><span class=caption-body>A.A.

Today, taking a photo is as easy as pulling your phone out of your pocket and clicking a button – but it took a long, difficult road and some incredible photography firsts to get us to where we are today.</p><p>It all started with one photograph – <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the first ever taken</a>. It was the mid-1820s, and a French man named Joseph Nicéphore Niépce was experimenting with his new invention. He'd found a way to make images by getting asphalt to harden in different degrees when touched by light. He set his system up at his window and, for the first time in human history, captured a photographic representation of the world.</p><p>It didn't look like much. The light left nothing more than a thin, barely visible shadow on a sheet of metal. It was nearly completely imperceptible, and it took more than eight hours to develop. Those thin shadows, though, were the start of something incredible.</p><p>By 1839, Louis Daguerre had taken Niépce's ideas and improved them enough to release his own camera to the world. Some say it was then that photography was truly born. For the first time, using Daguerre's daguerreotype method, the general public was able to take photographs of the world around them. The process still took hours, and it made photographing anything that moves nearly impossible – but not completely.</p><p>The very year the daguerreotype hit the market, there was another photography first: the first portrait. An American named Robert Cornelius stood completely still for 15 minutes straight and, in the process, created the first daguerreotype focused on a person's face.</p><p>From there, the technology took off. A year later, John Draper made the next photography first by taking a photograph of outer space: a close-up shot of the moon. The first photographic hoax followed quickly on its tails, and then the first scenes of everyday life. Photographs started appearing in newspapers, then they became dashed with color, and the history of photography goes on from there...</p><p>All these photography firsts turned the art into what it is today. But everything we have today, every photograph and film we see, the entire history of photography, all started with those thin shadows, cast through Niépce's window, imprinted onto a sheet of metal.</p><p>After this tour through the history of photography, <a href=#>see the very first photograph ever taken</a>, or check out these <a href=#>50 photographs that changed the world</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyptdKtpquxXaSzbrzHqKuon6KWvanF</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhistory-of-photography.html&text=The%20History%20Of%20Photography%20In%2027%20Groundbreaking%20Images&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhistory-of-photography.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhistory-of-photography.html&title=The%20History%20Of%20Photography%20In%2027%20Groundbreaking%20Images" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhistory-of-photography.html&title=The%20History%20Of%20Photography%20In%2027%20Groundbreaking%20Images" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhistory-of-photography.html&title=The%20History%20Of%20Photography%20In%2027%20Groundbreaking%20Images" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhistory-of-photography.html&description=The%20History%20Of%20Photography%20In%2027%20Groundbreaking%20Images" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./actor-navdeep-spotted-in-a-long-hair-and-unkempt-beard.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Actor Navdeep Spotted In A Long Hair And Unkempt Beard">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1325539-road-dogg-billy-gunn-texted-im-in-for-wwe-dx-reunion-hes-not-he-wasnt-there.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Road Dogg: Billy Gunn Texted Im In For WWE DX Reunion, Hes Upset He Wasnt There">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
