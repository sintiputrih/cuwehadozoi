After all, in decades past, people who wanted to become famous only had a small number of options including being an actor, musician, athlete, writer, or politician. These days, however, it often feels like there are infinite ways to wind up in the spotlight since there are so many new kinds of famous people including, influencers, “reality” stars, and YouTubers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To make it big on the world’s most famous video platform, <a href=#>some YouTubers try hard to run interesting channels</a>. On the other hand, <a href=#>some YouTubers seek out constant drama</a> to garner the world’s attention. No matter which route YouTubers take, it has become clear that most people who become famous on the platform put a lot of work into their channels. With that in mind, it is fascinating to look at how rich a YouTuber like Trisha Paytas has become and how they make money.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Tana Mongeau Became A Rich YouTuber</a></span></p><h2 id=fame-and-fortune>Fame And Fortune</h2><p>Throughout Trisha Paytas’ adult life, they tried their hand at more traditional methods of attaining fame and fortune. For example, as an actor, Paytas landed roles in movies like Yes Man and Wanderlust in addition to appearing in shows like Modern Family and Nathan For You. Paytas has also tried to become a successful musician by releasing several albums and singles. Heck, Paytas even tried to become a Guinness World Record holder but they failed at their attempt to become the fastest talker on record.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite all of Paytas’ attempts to become a more traditional celebrity, it wasn’t until they started a YouTube channel under the name blndsundoll4mj that things really took off for them. Eventually able to attract a huge audience to their YouTube channel, whenever <a href=#>Paytas does things like stand up to Joe Rogan</a>, it helps to make their following grow. As a result, loads of people flock to watch whenever Paytas uploads a new vlog, music video, or mukbang video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, it has become increasingly hard to estimate how much money YouTubers make from the website. After all, YouTubers make different amounts depending on how family-friendly their channel is since the website pays more or less money depending on the type of ads they can play on your channel. When it comes to Paytas’ channel, however, people have been able to analyze how many views Trisha’s videos get and the type of ads that play before and during their videos. Based on all of that information, it is abundantly clear that Paytas makes thousands from YouTube daily.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Internet Personality Trisha Paytas Fires Back At Gabbie Hanna Targeting Their In New Song</a></span></p><h2 id=other-efforts>Other Efforts</h2><p>Since Trisha Paytas became famous, it has been abundantly clear that they are willing to take their career in a variety of directions if it means making money. For example, Paytas has become the host of several different podcasts over the years including The Dish with Trish, Let’s Talk About Sex, and Frenemies. Based on the popularity those podcasts have enjoyed, it is clear that Paytas cashed in on them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paytas also joined the cast of Celebrity Big Brother 20 which is a really big deal since that makes them a part of one of the most successful “reality” TV franchises in the world. Unfortunately for Paytas, they left the house after only 11 days and Trisha has since called their time on the show “the worst experience of (their) life”. While it is unfortunate that Paytas was so unhappy while filming that show, it is known that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Big Brother pays stars a lot of money</a> to take part in the series.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Trisha Paytas Says This Was "The Worst Experience Of Their Life"</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=onlyfans-fortune>OnlyFans Fortune</h2><p>Over the last while, it has become increasingly common for celebrities to join OnlyFans. The reason for that is that some stars clearly have raked in money hand over fist from the popular website. Never one to pass on an opportunity to make money, Trisha Paytas opened an OnlyFans account in 2021 and it is very clear that has been an incredibly financially rewarding decision for them.</p><p>Of course, it should be obvious that observers can't know exactly how much money people make from OnlyFans. In Trisha Paytas’ case, that is especially true since they say that most of the money they make from OnlyFans is from private sessions and video sales. However, when they responded to Joe Rogan following his comments about them, Trisha talked about how much money they make on OnlyFans. “I make about, I don’t know if I wanna say, but at the height of it I made about a million dollars a month, just saying. And I still rake it in.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on all of the ways that Trisha Paytas makes money, it should go without saying that they have amassed an impressive fortune. Even with that in mind, it may shock some observers that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paytas is worth $10 million</a> as of this writing, according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How YouTuber Jake Paul Is Adding To His $17 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq6Gjna5uvMCyq5qrXaOytXnWqKmtoF2ku63FjJ%2BYp6tf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftrisha-paytas-net-worth-only-fans.html&text=The%20Truth%20About%20Trisha%20Paytas%20Insane%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftrisha-paytas-net-worth-only-fans.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftrisha-paytas-net-worth-only-fans.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Trisha%20Paytas%20Insane%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftrisha-paytas-net-worth-only-fans.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Trisha%20Paytas%20Insane%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftrisha-paytas-net-worth-only-fans.html&title=The%20Truth%20About%20Trisha%20Paytas%20Insane%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftrisha-paytas-net-worth-only-fans.html&description=The%20Truth%20About%20Trisha%20Paytas%20Insane%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./5-letter-words-with-i-as-the-only-vowel-wordle-game-help.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Letter Words with I as the only vowel  Wordle Game Help">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sza-drake-relationship-age-mr-right-now-song-lyrics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="SZA Talks Drake Relationship &amp;amp; How Old She Was When They Dated  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
