When the victim is a young person with his or her whole life ahead of them, it makes their death even harder to stomach. For someone so young, Emani Asghedom has already experienced the horrors of losing a loving parent. She is the daughter of the late rapper- Nipsey Hussle who was fatally shot outside his store – Marathon Clothing in March 2019.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content"><span class=ez-toc-js-icon-con><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></span></a></span><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Biography_of_Emani_Asghedom></span><strong>Biography of Emani Asghedom</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Emani Asghedom was born in California on the 9th of November 2008 to Ermias Joseph Asghedom and Tanisha Foster. Soon after her birth, her parents went their separate ways but they shared custody of Emani who principally lived with her dad.</p><p>Growing up as a smart girl, Emani who also doubles as the eldest child of the late rapper graduated from elementary school in 2019 when she was 10 years old. During the graduation which was attended by her mother, aunty, and little brother among others, she paid tribute to her father.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Here_is_everything_we_know_about_Emani_Asghedom></span><strong>Here is everything we know about Emani Asghedom</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/jukebugs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tanisha-Foster-e1622902904719.jpg><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1_Emani_was_caught_in_a_long_custody_battle_after_the_death_of_her_father></span><strong>1. Emani was caught in a long custody battle after the death of her father.</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>For someone who has experienced the life-changing loss of a father, Emani had to face another messy battle about who gets to be her legal guardian between her father’s family and her mother.</p><p>Naturally, one would expect that Emani’s mother would get her custody as her only surviving parent but Nipsey Hussle’s family filed to make her remain in the family.</p><p>They believe her mother to be unfit and doesn’t have the capacity to provide her with a stable home. So they thought it wise that Emani remains with the family with whom she has the closest ties.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2_Her_mother_has_denied_the_allegations_of_being_an_unfit_mother></span><strong>2. Her mother has denied the allegations of being an unfit mother</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Nipsey Hussle’s family believes that Tanisha Foster is fighting for Emani’s custody so as to have unhindered access to her inheritance.</p><p>In the petition filed against her in court, asides from having several criminal records, including a DUI conviction and other arrests, Tanisha has also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">been accused</a> of not taking up an active role in the lives of her 2 older children.</p><p>Her older daughter who should be around 20 now went into juvenile detention in Los Angeles for petty theft. According to reports, she has been in and out of the juvenile court system since age 12 and her mother never stepped forward to take responsibility for her.</p><p>Moreover, her 19-year-old son is said to bounce around from home to home and doesn’t attend school regularly.</p><p>Tanisha might have also shot herself in the leg when she announced that Nipsey Hussle has been the one paying her rent and giving her money to cover other necessities.</p><p>She also claimed that she had been forced to rely on “the goodwill of family and friends” for food, shelter, transportation, and clothing since he died. All this has gone ahead to build a strong case against her in court.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=3_Emani_has_moved_in_with_her_aunty-_Samantha_since_her_father_died></span><strong>3. Emani has moved in with her aunty- Samantha since her father died</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Before the custody battle began, Emani already moved in with her father’s sister- Samantha who has been a constant figure in her life while growing up. Samantha lived with Nipsey and Emani from 2008 until 2015 and assisted with Emani’s day-to-day care.</p><p>Even after she moved out, she maintained consistent and frequent contact with Emani on a weekly basis.</p><p>While Samantha was granted temporary custody of Emani as the court proceedings went on, at the end of the day, the late rapper’s mother-Angelique Smith, and his siblings – Sam Asghedom and Samantha Smith and – were granted guardianship after providing sufficient evidence to the court for their petition.</p><p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;<a href=#>Nina Yankovic: 7 Interesting Things To Know About Weird Al Yankovic’s Daughter</a></strong></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=4_Does_Emani_have_siblings></span><strong>4.

Kross is the only child between Nipsey Hussle and his longtime love – Lauren London.</p><p>As expected, Kross Ermias Asghedom who was born in 2016 remains in the custody of his mother who also has another kid from a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">previous relationship</a> she had with Lil Wayne.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=5_Emanis_relationship_with_her_mother></span><strong>5. Emani’s relationship with her mother</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Emani and probably Tanisha are the only ones that can reveal the true state of their relationship. Since her father died and the long custody battle that ensued, Tanisha has appeared to have taken a more active role in Emani’s life. She posts pictures of them on her social media with different captions about missing her.</p><p>Moreover, Emani paid a heartwarming tribute to her mother and late father at her elementary school graduation. She thanked her mom for believing in her and her dad for being there for her.</p><p>In the same vein, Tanisha has been criticized online after a video went viral allegedly showing Emani being left outside of their home alone because her mother cleaned up. In the video where she was seen crying, she claimed that she went to her grandfather’s house but even though his car was outside, no one opened the door for her.</p><p>The case was more saddening when<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she revealed</a> that she was yelled at continuously and made to do stuff on the day her father died. Fans went as far as calling on Lauren London to intervene.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51ksq6tzaJkmquXnbKlu8xmnK%2Bdoq7BqbXNoGSamp%2BqwW66yKmqnrFdncK0v8ueqmackaq0qcDEq2SsoZ6Ysm60xKtkn5mknbKzecOinJ1n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2femani-asghedom-everything-about-nipsey-hussles-daughter-since-her-father-died.html&text=Emani%20Asghedom-%20Facts%20About%20Nipsey%20Hussle%27s%20Daughter%20Since%20He%20Died&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2femani-asghedom-everything-about-nipsey-hussles-daughter-since-her-father-died.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2femani-asghedom-everything-about-nipsey-hussles-daughter-since-her-father-died.html&title=Emani%20Asghedom-%20Facts%20About%20Nipsey%20Hussle%27s%20Daughter%20Since%20He%20Died" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2femani-asghedom-everything-about-nipsey-hussles-daughter-since-her-father-died.html&title=Emani%20Asghedom-%20Facts%20About%20Nipsey%20Hussle%27s%20Daughter%20Since%20He%20Died" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2femani-asghedom-everything-about-nipsey-hussles-daughter-since-her-father-died.html&title=Emani%20Asghedom-%20Facts%20About%20Nipsey%20Hussle%27s%20Daughter%20Since%20He%20Died" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2femani-asghedom-everything-about-nipsey-hussles-daughter-since-her-father-died.html&description=Emani%20Asghedom-%20Facts%20About%20Nipsey%20Hussle%27s%20Daughter%20Since%20He%20Died" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./home-spurs-concern-over-size-potential-use-as-vacation-rental.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Home spurs concern over size, potential use as vacation rental | News, Sports, Jobs">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./diamond-27s-rotom.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Diamond's Rotom - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
