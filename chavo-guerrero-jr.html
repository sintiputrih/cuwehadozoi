The promotion debuted on July 11 with their first show that featured wrestling from El Patron, El Hijo del Fantasma, L.A. Park, <a href=#>Thunder Rosa</a>, <a href=#>Bestia 666</a>, and Bandido. Three days later their promotion debuted their weekly show on Imagen TV in Mexico.</p><p>On September 13, 2019, he made an appearance for TNA, now known as Impact Wrestling at their Operation Override Twitch special.

His Uncle <a href=#>Mando Guerrero</a>, held the same position in the original GLOW series that inspired the Netflix show. Chavo appeared in front of the camera for two episodes of the second season as the wrestler Chico Guapo.</p><p>He made an appearance as the fictional wrestler James Vasquez also known as El Mayordomo on the NBC TV series Grimm's fifth-season episode "Silence of the Slams". The episode aired on March 18, 2016. Also in 2016 Chavo played as a character named "Silas" in "Fight to the Finish", an action/sport/romance and was directed by Warren Sheppard. He also played a character named "Tex-Mex" in the movie 2016 Vigilante Diaries, an action movie.</p><p>Guerrero worked with Lion Forge Studios to create "Chavo Guerrero's Warrior's Creed" which stars the main character as himself. The first issue was published in June 2016. At least four issues of the comic have been published. The comics were written by author <a href=#>Fabian Nicieza</a>.</p><p>In July 2016, Guerrero and his father were named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018.</p><p>In September 2014, it was reported that Guerrero had signed with Lucha Underground. Guerrero wrestled in the first match of the debut episode of Lucha Underground on October 29, losing to <a href=#>Blue Demon Jr.</a> On November 5 episode, Guerrero used a chair to attack both <a href=#>Blue Demon Jr.</a> and <a href=#>Sexy Star</a>, who was Guerrero's tag partner earlier in the episode, turning Heel in the process. On January 7, 2015, episode (taped October 5, 2014), Guerrero participated in a 20-men Aztec Warfare battle royal to become the inaugural Lucha Underground Champion. However, he was attacked by Blue Demon and eliminated by <a href=#>Sexy Star</a>. On January 18, 2015, (aired February 18) Guerrero was defeated by Mil Muertes and left Lucha Underground.</p><p>On May 20, 2015, Guerrero appeared in a video where he offered his help to Aztec Dragon to save his protegeé, Black Lotus. However, on June 3, Guerrero attacked Lotus, aligned himself with Dario Cueto and The Crew. Guerrero returned to Lucha Underground on June 10 (taped March 22, 2015), defeating <a href=#>Blue Demon Jr.</a> On January 10, 2016, Guerrero won the vacant Gift of the Gods Championship in a match also involving Aero Star, El Siniestro de la Muerte, Joey Ryan, <a href=#>Sexy Star</a>, Texano, and The Mack, though he lost the championship a week later to Cage. On November 3 Guerrero lost to Rey Mysterio in a "loser leaves Lucha Underground" match and per stipulation had to leave the temple.</p><p>On August 2, 2014, Guerrero teamed with his father <a href=#>Chavo Guerrero Sr.</a> at Vendetta Pro Wrestling's "Summer Sizzle V – VendettaVersary" event in a "Father & Son vs. Father & Son" Tag Team match against La Familia de Tijuana (Damián 666 and Bestia 666). Los Guerreros picked up the win. Following the match, Damián made a challenge to Guerrero Jr. to a hair-vs-hair match, in which he volunteered to put Bestia's hair on the line against the hair of Guerrero Sr. Guerrero Jr. picked up the win, but Bestia fled the arena, claiming later that he never agreed to the stipulation himself. On September 19, 2014, Guerrero made his debut for Chikara, when he, Hernandez and Homicide, representing LAX, took part in the 2014 King of Trios. They were eliminated from the tournament in the first round by the Golden Trio (Dasher Hatfield, Icarus and Mark Angelosetti).</p><p>As a singles wrestler, he is a former ECW World Champion in WWE, and a six-time Cruiserweight Champion between both WWE and WCW. He has also achieved success in tag team wrestling, being a five-time world tag team champion – winning the WWE Tag Team Championship twice with <a href=#>Eddie Guerrero</a> as Los Guerreros, the WCW World Tag Team Championship once with Corporal Cajun as the Misfits in Action, and the TNA World Tag Team Championship twice with Hernandez. Between WCW, WWE, and TNA, Guerrero has held a dozen total championships.</p><p>Guerrero and Hernandez received their rematch for the titles on March 10 at Lockdown, but were again defeated by Aries and Roode in a three-way match, also involving Daniels and Kazarian. On following episode of Impact Wrestling, Guerrero and Hernandez were set for another shot at the titles, but the two were ambushed by the Aces & Eights before the match could start. The title match took place the following week, where Guerrero and Hernandez failed again to regain the TNA World Tag Team Championship, following interference from Daniels and Kazarian. On the next episode of Impact Wrestling, Guerrero and Hernandez defeated Daniels and Kazarian to earn another shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship. Guerrero and Hernandez received their title shot on April 11 episode of Impact Wrestling, where they defeated Aries and Roode in a Two-out-of-Three Falls match, with the added stipulation that they would have to break up if they lost, to regain the TNA World Tag Team Championship. On June 2 at Slammiversary XI, Guerrero and Hernandez lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship to Gunner and James Storm in a fatal four-way elimination match, also involving Austin Aries and Bobby Roode and Bad Influence. On the following episode of Impact Wrestling, Guerrero was defeated by Hernandez in a 2013 Bound for Glory Series qualifying match. On December 12, Guerrero collected a briefcase in the Feast or Fired match, which was revealed the following week to contain a pink slip meaning he was fired from TNA. Guerrero's profile was later removed from the official site, and TNA issued a press release confirming his release as legitimate.</p><p>Guerrero appeared for the first time since his WWE departure at World Wrestling Council (WWC)'s Anniversario event on July 15 and 16, 2011. On July 16, Guerrero defeated El Sensacional Carlitos and Orlando Colón to win the WWC Caribbean Heavyweight Championship. In December 2011, Guerrero took part in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's India project, Ring Ka King. During the first week of tapings, Guerrero and Bulldog Hart were crowned the promotion's inaugural Tag Team Champions. On July 28, 2012, Guerrero appeared at a Vendetta Pro Wrestling event in Lompoc, California, defeating Joey Ryan for the vacant Vendetta Pro Wrestling Heavyweight Championship, holding the title until October 27, 2012 when he lost it to <a href=#>Chris Masters</a>.</p><p>On July 18, 2012, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) announced that they had signed Guerrero to a contract. He made his debut on July 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, aligning himself with Hernandez and beginning a short feud with Gunner and Kid Kash. Guerrero appeared on August 12 at Hardcore Justice, where he teamed with Hernandez to defeat Gunner and Kash. The two subsequently set their sights on the TNA World Tag Team Championship, unsuccessfully challenging champions Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels and Kazarian) for the titles on September 6 episode of Impact Wrestling. Guerrero and Hernandez ultimately defeated Daniels and Kazarian on October 14 at Bound for Glory, in three-way match, also involving A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle to become the new TNA World Tag Team Champions. On January 25, at the tapings of January 31 episode of Impact Wrestling, Guerrero and Hernandez lost the TNA World Tag Team Championship to the Dirty Heels (Austin Aries and Bobby Roode).</p><p>On March 8, Guerrero was announced as a NXT Pro to <a href=#>Darren Young</a> for the fifth season of NXT. On the 6 May episode of SmackDown, Guerrero commentated on a match between Tyson Kidd and Sin Cara, which Sin Cara won. On the 13 May episode of SmackDown, Guerrero aided Sin Cara in his match against Daniel Bryan. At Over The Limit, Sin Cara defeated Guerrero, and again on SmackDown to end their feud. Afterward, Guerrero mainly appeared on NXT with <a href=#>Darren Young</a>. His last match in WWE was teaming up with JTG and Young against Yoshi Tatsu, Conor O'Brian and <a href=#>Vladimir Kozlov</a> on NXT in a losing effort. On June 25, 2011, at his request, Guerrero was released by WWE, ending his 10-year tenure there.</p><p>As part of the 2010 WWE Supplemental Draft, Guerrero was drafted back to the SmackDown brand. He started an alliance with Dolph Ziggler, and the duo defeated Christian in a handicap match. On July 9 episode of Smackdown, Guerrero competed in a triple threat Money in the Bank qualifying match, along with Ziggler and MVP. Throughout the match, it became apparent that <a href=#>Vickie Guerrero</a> (Ziggler's manager) had told Guerrero and Ziggler to work together to ensure Ziggler qualified for the match. During the match, however, when both MVP and Ziggler were down, Guerrero attempted to pin MVP to win the match himself, turning his back on Vickie and Ziggler, thus ending the alliance.</p><p>Guerrero was drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft. He then became involved in the feud between <a href=#>Vickie Guerrero</a> and <a href=#>Santino Marella</a>. At Extreme Rules, Guerrero and Vickie were defeated by Marella in a Hog Pen match. Upon Vickie's departure from WWE, Guerrero continued to feud with Marella and defeated him on June 18 episode of WWE Superstars. Guerrero next feuded with <a href=#>Hornswoggle</a>, where the two faced off in various types of matches (in which a handicap of some sort was imposed on Guerrero by the various celebrity guests left in charge of Raw every week) with <a href=#>Hornswoggle</a> gaining the wins. Guerrero finally picked up a win when he teamed with <a href=#>Chris Masters</a> to defeat <a href=#>Hornswoggle</a> and <a href=#>Santino Marella</a> in a tag team match on September 28, 2009 episode of Raw. Their feud won the award of Worst Feud of the Year by Wrestling Observer Newsletter.</p><p>Guerrero remained inactive until the December 18, 2007 episode of ECW, where he appeared after the main event between WWE United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter and ECW Champion CM Punk and attacked the vulnerable Punk, sending a message that he wanted a title shot. Guerrero challenged Punk to several matches until he finally won the third after interference from World Heavyweight Champion Edge to earn a championship match. On January 22 episode of ECW, Guerrero defeated Punk in a No Disqualification match to win the ECW title following interference from Edge. In the process he proclaimed Edge and company as his "familia". He then successfully defended his title against Punk at No Way Out and on March 4 episode of ECW.</p><p>On June 25, 2007, <a href=#>Chris Benoit</a> (a close friend of Guerrero), his wife Nancy, and their son Daniel were found dead at their home (their deaths have since been ruled a double homicide-suicide perpetrated by Chris Benoit). Guerrero was reportedly one of the last people to talk to Benoit and one of the people to whom Benoit sent text messages before committing suicide.</p><p>On August 30, 2007, Guerrero, along with nine other WWE wrestlers were named by Sports Illustrated to be given illegal steroids not in compliance with the Talent Wellness program. Guerrero received somatropin, nandrolone, and anastrozole between April 2005 and May 2006. <a href=#>Chris Benoit</a>, <a href=#>Eddie Guerrero</a>, and <a href=#>Brian Adams</a> were also discovered to have been given steroids prior to their deaths during this investigation, as well as <a href=#>Sylvain Grenier</a>.</p><p>On the February 24, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero attacked Randy Orton when Orton began to insult Eddie and the heritage of the Guerreros. Guerrero was soon dragged out by security. On the February 27 episode of Raw, Guerrero faced off against Shelton Benjamin in a qualifying match for the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 22. During the match, Orton interfered and hit Guerrero with the RKO, allowing Benjamin to get the pinfall victory. He proceeded to unsuccessfully challenge Benjamin for the WWE Intercontinental Championship on the April 3 episode of Raw. In a segment that aired on WWE Unlimited, an emotional Guerrero decided to quit WWE, in storyline, after believing he had let his family, Eddie, and the fans down and expressed his doubts about being a wrestler.</p><p>Guerrero then turned his attention to Rey Mysterio, whom he had put out of action, in storyline, in 2006. Before Mysterio's return at SummerSlam, Guerrero mocked Mysterio's knee injury and taunted him during matches. He was, however, unable to defeat Mysterio at the pay-per-view. Guerrero then lost an "I Quit" rematch to Mysterio, after Mysterio assaulted his left knee with a steel chair. This allowed Guerrero to have time off to serve his suspension for violating the WWE Wellness Policy.</p><p>In June, Guerrero became one of the last minute trades in the 2005 WWE Draft, which saw him jump from SmackDown! to the Raw brand. The next week, on Raw, he denounced his Hispanic heritage in favor of the "Anglo-American way". This came after two weeks of being battered by the Mexican faction, The Mexicools. It led to the changing of his persona to "Kerwin White", a stereotypical, middle-class, white, conservative, Anglo-American man. He dyed his hair blond and often drove a golf cart to the ring which held his golf clubs. Soon after his debut, White started making suggestive remarks towards African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and other non-White people, specifically directed towards Shelton Benjamin. On an episode of Raw, White cost Benjamin a match against Rob Conway. Benjamin defeated White by disqualification the following week when White attacked him with his golf club. At Unforgiven, White was beaten by Benjamin. White then hired Nick Nemeth as his new "caddy" to help him in his matches.</p><p>On the morning of November 13, 2005, Guerrero checked into the same hotel as his uncle, Eddie, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Guerrero was alerted by hotel security that Eddie did not respond to a wake-up call and opened the locked door to the room, Guerrero found his uncle unconscious. Guerrero attempted CPR but Eddie was declared dead when paramedics arrived on the scene. Later that afternoon, Guerrero appeared at a press conference with WWE chairman Vince McMahon to address Eddie's death. These events resulted in Guerrero dropping the Kerwin White gimmick and wrestling under his real name as a face. He defeated John "Bradshaw" Layfield (JBL) on the November 18, 2005 episode of SmackDown!, using the "Three Amigos" triple suplexes and the Frog Splash in tribute to Eddie. He also used the cheating tactic, "playing possum," which Eddie made famous: behind the back of the distracted referee, Guerrero gently tossed a steel chair to a dazed Layfield while Guerrero lied down, pretending to have been hit. The referee then turned and, seeing the "unconscious" Guerrero, almost disqualified the oblivious, chair-wielding Layfield but stopped short so the tribute-style match could continue.</p><p>Soon after returning to the active roster, Guerrero was aligned with his uncle Eddie, forming the tag team Los Guerreros. In contrast to his previous WCW storyline with his uncle, Guerrero fully adopted his uncle's policy of "Lie, Cheat and Steal" to win matches as part of the gimmick. Los Guerreros won the tag team championships at Survivor Series, when they defeated Kurt Angle and <a href=#>Chris Benoit</a> and Edge and Rey Mysterio in a Triple threat tag team elimination match. The duo turned face due to their popularity. On the February 6, 2003 episode of SmackDown!, Los Guerreros lost their tag team championships to Team Angle. At WrestleMania XIX, they were again defeated by Team Angle in a triple threat match for the tag team titles, also involving the team of Benoit and Rhyno. They continued to feud with Team Angle and won the championships back on the September 18 episode of SmackDown!. One month later, they lost the titles to The Basham Brothers. After losing their tag team championships, Guerrero became jealous of his uncle's growing popularity and WWE Championship ambitions, turned on Eddie, broke from the team, and turned heel again. He was soon joined by his father Chavo Sr. who sided with his son instead of his brother. Guerrero and his father teamed together to defeat Eddie and Kurt Angle on January 22, 2004 episode of SmackDown! Eddie, however, defeated Guerrero at the 2004 Royal Rumble to end their feud.</p><p>Guerrero's contract with WCW was one of the twenty-five contracts that were included in WCW's sale to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Like most of the wrestling talent that came over with WCW, Guerrero wrestled as a heel under the WCW banner as his WWF debut was as part of The Alliance, a group of WCW and ECW employees who had, in storyline, invaded WWF after their promotion was bought out. On April 13, 2002, Guerrero faced Billy Kidman on an episode of WWF Metal for the Cruiserweight Championship and lost the match via pinfall. Guerrero spent time as an undercard wrestler in the company, which was soon rebranded World Wrestling Entertainment, wrestling for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship on numerous occasions.</p><p>Guerrero won the Cruiserweight Championship from <a href=#>Mike Sanders</a> on December 6 episode of Thunder. He retained the title against Rey Mysterio Jr. on February 18, 2001 at the WCW SuperBrawl Revenge. As Cruiserweight Champion, Guerrero engaged in a feud against "Sugar" <a href=#>Shane Helms</a> eventually losing the championship to Helms at WCW Greed.</p><p>He was also a member of the comedy stable The Misfits in Action (MIA), consisting of himself, <a href=#>Hugh Morris</a> (better known as Bill Demott), <a href=#>Lash LeRoux</a> and <a href=#>Van Hammer</a>. They were managed by Major Gunns. Guerrero was billed as "Lieutenant Loco." As Loco, he defeated Daffney for the Cruiserweight Championship in a triangle match also involving Disco Inferno on June 7, 2000 episode of Thunder. On June 11, 2000 at The Great American Bash, Lt. Loco defeated Disco Inferno to retain the title. Loco lost the championship to Lance Storm a month later on Nitro. At WCW Mayhem, Loco left the MIA and reverted to Chavo Guerrero Jr.</p><p>On January 17, 1999 at Souled Out, Guerrero was defeated by <a href=#>Norman Smiley</a> in a match that was booked due to Guerrero's companion Pepe being burnt by Smiley, ending the Pepe gimmick.</p><p>Guerrero and Billy Kidman tag teamed for a WCW tag team title tournament held on Nitro. Guerrero then turned on Kidman after being eliminated from the tournament, starting a feud. Guerrero faced Kidman for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship on WCW Superbrawl 9 on February 21, 1999 but failed to win the championship.</p><p>While in WCW, Guerrero shared the limelight with his uncle Eddie, becoming a reluctant ally of his uncle's. As part of their storyline, Eddie continually tried to make Guerrero adopt Eddie's cheating tactics, but he often refused to do so. Eventually, Guerrero's treatment at the hands of Eddie would drive him "crazy," and he adopted the gimmick of a psycho fixated with a hobby horse he dubbed "Pepé."
