Over the course of an hour-long conversation at FX headquarters in Los Angeles, they teased, complimented, and boosted one another, and reminisced about working together like the best of besties. They laughed and teared up discussing what their first big roles have meant to them, and revealed that they are nothing like their TV characters. Mikey, 19, who lives in L.A.’s Valley has none of Max’s self-centeredness; Hannah, 15, who lives in Birmingham, Alabama, is softer and more sensitive than Frankie; and 12-year-old Olivia is a total ham who lives in Long Island and is savvier than Duke.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cju2v2xdp00123a67kak0p0a4@published data-word-count=82>Co-created by <a href=#>Pamela Adlon</a>, who directed the entire third season and stars as the girls’ mother, Sam Fox, Better Things depicts life in a single working mother household like no other TV show does. Mikey, Hannah, and Olivia view Adlon as their role model and inspiration, and say they’re grateful for the opportunities the show has afforded them — namely, working with a monkey, learning choreography, and traveling to Canada together. The following is an edited and condensed version of our conversation.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cju2v2zw2003z3a67mo88gn1m@published data-word-count=70><strong>I would love to hear how the three of you got into acting.</strong><br>Olivia:<strong> </strong>When I was 2, I was in my parents’ room and I was watching this Gap Kids commercial.

I turned 15, and all of a sudden, I became really interested in this. I’m not really sure what sparked that in my head, but it did. My dad’s a big film buff, so I think I acquired some of those traits.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cju2v2xkq001c3a67hxs2kxku@published data-word-count=40><strong>Did you know people in school that were in acting, or did you know anybody in the business?</strong><br>Mikey: No one in my family is in the business.

How did it come about?</strong><br>Olivia: It started with putting a little tiny scene on tape. I got a callback, there was one more little audition, and then I actually met Pamela in New York. We read one scene and we did a little bit of improv. It was automatic, like, Oh my God, she’s so cool! [Laughs.] And then about one or two weeks later, she asked me, “Do you wanna play Duke on Better Things?”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cju2v2xm3001f3a679rv5c18b@published data-word-count=63>Mikey:<strong> </strong>Before I met you, Pamela was talking about how excited she was that you were coming. She was like, “You’re gonna love Olivia and her audition tape!

A week later, I got a call saying that Pamela wanted to have a chemistry read with me. I was in the room with them for like two hours and my mom was waiting outside. I remember thinking, Oh my gosh, my mom’s waiting, should I go check on her and see if she’s okay?

But in the eulogy episode when you’re eulogizing her, your character says something like — I’m gonna butcher it, but it was like: “I feel like I have to put this on you because I can’t take it.

Then the next day, I asked if I could go up and get lunch and they said they’d bring it to me in my trailer. I was disappointed because I had been in my trailer for a little bit and I was antsy.
