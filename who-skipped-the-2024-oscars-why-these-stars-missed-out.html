However, when the time to announce the Best Picture winner came, Pacino, 83, <a href=#>took the stage solo</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a> reported Sunday night that Pfeiffer, 65, skipped out on the ceremony due to “personal family reasons” that kept her on the East Coast.</p><p>Instead of a 40-year Scarface reunion at the Oscars, Pacino’s appearance was pegged to the 50th anniversary of The Godfather Part II, which was released in 1974. (Pacino’s costar from the film <strong>Robert De Niro</strong> was in the audience and stood for the actor’s entrance.)</p><p>Every other previously announced presenter took the stage on Sunday, but a few other notable names — even those nominated — seemed to skip out on the ceremony. Keep scrolling to see who missed the Oscars, and why:</p><h3>Eva Mendes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eva-Mendes-Who-Skipped-the-2024-Oscars.jpg><p>Despite her man, <strong>Ryan Gosling</strong>, getting nominated— and even performing <a href=#>“I’m Just Ken”</a> — Mendes was missing from the audience. (Gosling was up for Best Supporting Actor and performed the Best Original Song nominee for Barbie.)</p><p>Mendes did, however, appear to be backstage, per various social media posts she shared from the show. “You took Ken all the way to the Oscar’s, RG. Now come home, we need to put the kids to bed,” she <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned an Instagram</a> from what appeared to be Gosling’s dressing room.</p><h3>Warren Beatty</h3><p><strong>Annette Bening</strong> was nominated in the Best Actress category for her role as Diana Nyad in Nyad, but her famous Oscar-winning husband was not there to show his support.</p><h3>Leonardo DiCaprio</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Leonardo-DiCaprio-Who-Skipped-the-2024-Oscars.jpg><p>DiCaprio was the literal star of <a href=#>Killers of the Flower Moon</a>, which racked up 10 awards, but didn’t show up for the ceremony to support his director<strong> Martin Scorsese</strong>&nbsp;or costar <strong>Lily Gladstone</strong>; DiCaprio did not receive a Best Actor nod for his performance.</p><h3>Matt Damon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Matt-Damon-Who-Skipped-the-2024-Oscars.jpg><p>The jury’s still out on whether or not Damon was actually inside the Oscar’s ceremony — but he did make it to <a href=#>the Vanity Fair afterparty</a>. Before the awards show, host <strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong> confirmed to <a href=# rel=noopener>CNN</a> that Damon would not be in attendance.</p><p>“What really happened? He couldn’t get a ticket,” Kimmel joked at the time. “It’s one of the saddest things I’ve ever heard. He asked if he could come and they told him, ‘Sorry – nominees only.’”</p><p>While Damon did not get nominated for his role as Leslie Groves in Oppenheimer, the film received 13 nominations and t<a href=#>ook home Best Picture</a>.</p><h3>Wes Anderson</h3><p>The director took home his first-ever Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. He was not present at the ceremony to accept the award. <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Weekly</a> confirmed that Anderson’s absence was because production on his forthcoming film officially started on Monday, March 11.</p><h3>Gigi Hadid</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gigi-Hadid-Who-Skipped-the-2024-Oscars.jpg><p>The model decided not to attend the Oscars despite her man, <strong>Bradley Cooper</strong>, nabbing a Best Actor nomination for his role in Maestro. (Cooper directed and produced the biopic, which won zero of its seven nominations.) Due to the low-key nature of their romance, this is less than surprising. However, Us can wish for a red carpet debut.</p><h3>Joshua Jackson</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Joshua-Jackson-Who-Skipped-the-2024-Oscars.jpg><p>Another budding couple lost their opportunity to go public on the Oscars red carpet when <strong>Lupita Nyong’o</strong> arrived at the event with A Quiet Place: Day One costar <strong>Joseph Quinn</strong> instead of Jackson. (Nyong’o and Jackson were photographed packing on the PDA on trip to Mexico days before the Academy Awards.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>Michelle Pfeiffer</h3><p>Deadline reported on Sunday that Pfeiffer missed her presenting gig following “personal family reasons.”</p><h3>Hayao Miyazaki and Toshio Suzuki</h3><p>The Boy and the Heron‘s Japaense filmmakers skipped out on the Oscars despite winning for Best Animated Feature. Their absence was due to their age — Miyazaki is 83 years old and Suzuki is 75 years old — per a statement to <a href=# rel=noopener>USA Today</a>.</p><p>“I am very appreciative that the work that was created after overcoming these difficulties has been seen by so many people around the world,” <strong>Kiyofumi Nakajima</strong>, chief operating officer for Studio Ghibli, said. “Both Hayao and I have aged considerably. I am grateful to receive such an honor at my age and taking this as a message to continue my work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6hp12ouKq8z56bZqyYmnpzfJFtZKirk5a%2FtHnWobBmrJiawKZ50q2Yq6tdora0v8SdZKitpGQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-skipped-the-2024-oscars-why-these-stars-missed-out.html&text=Who%20Skipped%20the%202024%20Oscars%3f%20Why%20These%20Stars%20Missed%20Out&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-skipped-the-2024-oscars-why-these-stars-missed-out.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-skipped-the-2024-oscars-why-these-stars-missed-out.html&title=Who%20Skipped%20the%202024%20Oscars%3f%20Why%20These%20Stars%20Missed%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-skipped-the-2024-oscars-why-these-stars-missed-out.html&title=Who%20Skipped%20the%202024%20Oscars%3f%20Why%20These%20Stars%20Missed%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-skipped-the-2024-oscars-why-these-stars-missed-out.html&title=Who%20Skipped%20the%202024%20Oscars%3f%20Why%20These%20Stars%20Missed%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-skipped-the-2024-oscars-why-these-stars-missed-out.html&description=Who%20Skipped%20the%202024%20Oscars%3f%20Why%20These%20Stars%20Missed%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ayra-starr-reacts-to-her-album-leak.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ayra Starr Reacts To Her Album Leak">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sheetal-patra.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sheetal Patra">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
