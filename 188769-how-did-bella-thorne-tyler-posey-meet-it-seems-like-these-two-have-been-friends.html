But Thorne fans needn't worry that she was lonely, because about a month later, reports surfaced that Thorne was dating <i>Teen Wolf </i>star Tyler Posey, and they have been pretty inseparable ever since. So, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>how did Thorne and Posey meet</a>?</p><p>Soon after cozy photos of them surfaced, their relationship seemed to evolve very fast, which could be attributed to a previous friendship... or just a good old fashioned whirlwind romance. As it turns out, the reason these two looked so close, so fast was that they had been friends for at least a year before they started dating romantically... and there could be some drama involved.</p><p>An interesting thing to note is that <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Posey is friends with Sulkin</a>, a relationship that seemed to start they both starred in the 2012 film <i>White Frog </i>together. Just a few months before she began dating Sulkin, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Thorne was linked to Posey in April 2015</a>, but they disregarded the news as simply rumors and were nothing more than friends. Because Sulkin and Thorne were also friends before they dated, it might be logical to assume that they had all met throughout the years and that Thorne was friends with both of them.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Thorne and Posey were photographed walking</a> arm-in-arm in late April 2015, kicking off the first rumors that they were dating. E! reported that the two had just presented together at the MTV Upfronts, where they were both supporting their recent projects. Thorne took to her Twitter to dispel the rumors right away:</p><p>It sounds like she was actually very serious about being upfront with her dating life, because ever since they did <i>actually</i> start dating, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Thorne and Posey have been pretty open</a> about being together.</p><p>Now, as to how exactly these two met, it looks like they definitely ran in the same circles. When <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Sulkin and Thorne were confirmed to be dating</a> back in August 2015, a source told <i>People</i> that they had "known each other for years and spend a lot of time together." So, if Thorne knew Sulkin for many years, it seems probably that she also met Posey throughout that time, since Sulkin and Posey were friends. And, you know, the whole young Hollywood world can be pretty tight knit. When those rumors and pap photos of Posey and Thorne first came out in early 2015, they looked to already have a close, established friendship.</p><p>One of <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Sulkin's tweets in the few weeks after his breakup</a> seemed like it could allude to his negative feelings about Posey and Thorne, according to Hollywood Life, so they might not be <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>as close friends as they all once were</a>. While the exact moment of their meeting isn't known, Posey and Thorne have been friends for a while and seem to have made the transition from friends to lovers really fast. And, well, that's young love for you.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyhJdwbXJlmKTEbrDInWSbnZyhrm7Ax6ipp51dqcatsdFmp6irla56rrHErWSirF2osqa50majoqOVYsGpsdKeZK2vn2K1osLEZpmenZ5is7O1xKebrA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f188769-how-did-bella-thorne-tyler-posey-meet-it-seems-like-these-two-have-been-friends.html&text=How%20Did%20Bella%20Thorne%20%26amp%3b%20Tyler%20Posey%20Meet%3f%20It%20Seems%20Like%20These%20Two%20Have%20Been%20Friends%20For%20A%20While&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f188769-how-did-bella-thorne-tyler-posey-meet-it-seems-like-these-two-have-been-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f188769-how-did-bella-thorne-tyler-posey-meet-it-seems-like-these-two-have-been-friends.html&title=How%20Did%20Bella%20Thorne%20%26amp%3b%20Tyler%20Posey%20Meet%3f%20It%20Seems%20Like%20These%20Two%20Have%20Been%20Friends%20For%20A%20While" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f188769-how-did-bella-thorne-tyler-posey-meet-it-seems-like-these-two-have-been-friends.html&title=How%20Did%20Bella%20Thorne%20%26amp%3b%20Tyler%20Posey%20Meet%3f%20It%20Seems%20Like%20These%20Two%20Have%20Been%20Friends%20For%20A%20While" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f188769-how-did-bella-thorne-tyler-posey-meet-it-seems-like-these-two-have-been-friends.html&title=How%20Did%20Bella%20Thorne%20%26amp%3b%20Tyler%20Posey%20Meet%3f%20It%20Seems%20Like%20These%20Two%20Have%20Been%20Friends%20For%20A%20While" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f188769-how-did-bella-thorne-tyler-posey-meet-it-seems-like-these-two-have-been-friends.html&description=How%20Did%20Bella%20Thorne%20%26amp%3b%20Tyler%20Posey%20Meet%3f%20It%20Seems%20Like%20These%20Two%20Have%20Been%20Friends%20For%20A%20While" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./karlee-eldridge-bio-age-dating-net-worth-height.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Actress Karlee Eldridge!
